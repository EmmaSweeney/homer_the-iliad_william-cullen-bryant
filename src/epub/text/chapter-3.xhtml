					<span>NOW when both armies were arrayed for war, Each with its chiefs, the Trojan host moved on With shouts and clang of arms, as when the cry Of cranes is in the air, that, flying south From winter and its mighty breadih of rain, s Wing their way over ocean, and at dawn Bring fearful battle to the pygmy race, Bloodshed and death. But silently the Greeks Went forward, breathing valor, mindful still To aid each other in the coming fray. m As when the south wind shrouds a mountain-top In vapors that awake the shepherd's fear, — A surer covert for the thief than night, — And round him one can only see as far As one can hurl a stone, —such was the cloud is Of dust that from the warriors' trampling feet Rose round their rapid march and filled the air. Now diew they near each other, face to face, And Paris in the Trojan van pressed on, In presence like a god. A leopard's hide *, Was thrown across his shoulders, and he bore A crooked bow and falchion. Brandishing Two brazen-pointed javelins, he defied To mortal fight the bravest of the Greeks. Him, Menelaus, loved of Mars, beheld »s Advancing with large strides before the rest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as a hungry lion who has made A prey of some large beast — a horned stag Or mountain goat — rejoices, and with speed Devours it, though swift hounds and sturdy youths v Press on his flank, so Menelaus felt Great joy when Paris, of the godlike form, Appeared in sight, for now he thought to wreak His vengeance on the guilty one, and straight Sprang from his car to earth with all his arms. y, But when the graceful Paris saw the chief Come toward him from the foremost ranks, his heart Was troubled, and he turned and passed among His fellow-warriors and avoided death. As one, who meets within a mountain glade *, A serpent, starts aside with sudden fright, And takes the backward way with trembling limbs And cheeks all white, — the graceful Paris thus Before the son of Atreus shrank in fear, And mingled with the high-souled sons of Troy. 4s Hector beheld and thus upbraided him Harshly: "O luckless Paris, nobly formed, Yet woman-follower and seducer! Thou Shouldst never have been born, or else at best Have died unwedded; better were it far, 51 Than thus to be a scandal and a scorn To all who look on thee. The long-haired Greeks, How they will laugh, who for thy gallant looks Deemed thee a hero, when there dwells in thee No spirit and no courage? Wast thou such</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When, crossing the great deep in thy stanch ships With chosen comrades, thou didst make thy way Among a stranger-people and bear off A beautiful woman from that distant land, Allied by marriage-ties to warrior-men,—- «0 A mischief to thy father and to us And all the people, to our foes a joy, And a disgrace to thee? Why couldst thou not Await Atrides? Then hadst thou been taught From what a valiant warrior thou didst take «s His blooming spouse. Thy harp will not avail, Nor all the gifts of Venus, nor thy locks, Nor thy fair form, when thou art laid in dust. Surely the sons of Troy are faint of heart, Else hadst thou, for the evil thou hast wrought, 70 Been laid beneath a coverlet of stone." Then Paris, of the godlike presence, spake In answer : " Hector, thy rebuke is just; Thou dost not wrong me. Dauntless is thy heart; T is like an axe when, wielded by the hand 7s That hews the shipwright's plank, it cuts right through, Doubling the wielder's force. Such tameless heart Dwells in thy bosom. Yet reproach me not With the fair gifts which golden Venus gave. Whatever in their grace the gods bestow , Is not to be rejected: 't is not ours To choose what they shall give us. But if thou Desirest to behold my prowess shown</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In combat, cause the Trojans and the Greeks To pause from battle, while, between the hosts, as I and the warlike Menelaus strive In single fight for Helen and her wealth. Whoever shall prevail and prove himself The better warrior, let him take with him The treasure and the woman, and depart; *» While all the other Trojans, having made A faithful league of amity, shall dwell On Ilium's fertile plain, and all the Greeks Return to Argos, famed for noble steeds, And to Achaia, famed for lovely dames." 9s He spake, and Hector, hearing him, rejoiced, And went between the hosts, and with his spear, Held by the middle, pressed the phalanxes Of Trojans back, and made them all sit down. The long-haired Greeks meanwhile, with bended bows, 190 Took aim against him, just about to send Arrows and stones; but Agamemnon, king Of men, beheld, and thus he cried aloud :— "Restrain yourselves, ye Argives; let not fly Your arrows, ye Achaians; Hector asks— ,0 s He of the beamy helmet asks to speak." He spake, and they refrained, and all, at once, Were silent. Hector then stood forth and said :— "Hearken, ye Trojans and ye nobly-armed Achaians, to what Paris says by me. u0 He bids the Trojans and the Greeks lay down</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their shining arms upon the teeming earth, And he and Menelaus, loved of Mars, Will strive in single combat, on the ground Between the hosts, for Helen and her wealth; ns And he who shall o'ercome, and prove himself The better warrior, to his home shall bear The treasure and the woman, while the rest Shall frame a solemn covenant of peace." He spake, and both the hosts in silence heard. ,» Then Menelaus, great in battle, said :— "Now hear me also, — me whose spirit feels The wrong most keenly. I propose that now The Greeks and Trojans separate reconciled, For greatly have ye suffered for the sake Of this my quarrel, and the original fault Of Paris. Whomsoever fate ordains To perish, let him die; but let the rest Be from this moment reconciled, and part. And bring an offering of two lambs — one white, 130 The other black — to Earth and to the Sun, And we ourselves will offer one to Jove. And be the mighty Priam here, that he May sanction this our compact, — for his sons Are arrogant and faithless, —lest some hand iss Wickedly break the covenant of Jove. The younger men are of a fickle mood; But when an elder shares the act he looks Both to the past and future, and provides What is most fitting and the best for all."</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He spake, and both the Greeks and Trojans heard His words with joy, and hoped the hour was come To end the hard-fought war. They reined their steeds Back to the ranks, alighted, and put off Their armor, which they laid upon the ground us Near them in piles, with little space between. Then Hector sent two heralds forth with speed Into the town, to bring the lambs and call King Priam. Meanwhile Agamemnon bade Talthybius seek the hollow ships and find A lamb for the altar. He obeyed the words Of noble Agamemnon, king of men. Meanwhile to white-armed Helen Iris came A messenger. She took a form that seemed Laodice, the sister of Paris, whom iss Antenor's son, King Helicaon, wed, — Fairest of Priam's daughters. She drew near To Helen, in the palace, weaving there An ample web, a shining double-robe, Whereon were many conflicts fairly wrought, «* Endured by the horse-taming sons of Troy And brazen-mailed Achaians for her sake Upon the field of Mars. Beside her stood Swift-footed Iris, and addressed her thus : — "Dear lady, come and see the Trojan knights* ,«s And brazen mailed Achaians doing things To wonder at. They who, in this sad war, Eager to slay each other, lately met</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In murderous combat on the field, are now Seated in silence, and the war hath ceased. 170 They lean upon their shields , their massive spears Are near them, planted in the ground upright. Paris, and Menelaus, loved of Mars, With their long lances will contend for thee, And thou wilt be declared the victor's spouse." 17s She said, and in the heart of Helen woke Dear recollections of her former spouse And of her home and kindred. Instantly She left her chamber, robed and veiled in white. And shedding tender tears; yet not alone, ,, For with her went two maidens, — ^tthra, child Of Pitheus, and the large-eyed Clymene. Straight to the Sciean gates they walked, by which Panthoiis, Priam, and Thymoetes sat, Lampus and Clytius, Hicetaon sprung 1«s From Mars, Antenor and Ucalegon, Two sages, — elders of the people all. Beside the gates they sat, unapt, through age, For tasks of war, but men of fluent speech, Like the cicadas that within the wood i*, Sit on the trees and utter delicate sounds. Such were the nobles of the Trojan race Who sat upon the tower. But when they marked The approach of Helen, to each other thus With winged words, but in low tones, they said :— •9s "Small blame is theirs, if both the Trojan knights And brazen-mailed Achaians have endured</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So long so many evils for the sake Of that one woman. She is wholly like In.feature to the deathless goddesses. =*w So be it: let her, peerless as she is, Return on board the fleet, nor stay to bring Disaster upon us and all our race." So spake the elders. Priam meantime called To Helen: "Come, dear daughter, sit by me. *,s Thou canst behold thy former husband hence, Thy kindred and thy friends. I blame thee not; The blame is with the immortals who have sent These pestilent Greeks against me. Sit and name For me this mighty man, the Grecian chief, Gallant and tall. True, there are taller men; But of such noble form arid dignity I never saw: in truth, a kingly man." And Helen, fairest among women, thus Answered: "Dear second father, whom at once «s I fear and honor, would that cruel death Had overtaken me before I left, To wander with thy son, my marriage-bed, And my dear daughter, and the company Of friends I loved. But that was not to be; »*, And now I pine and weep. Yet will I tell What thou dost ask. ' The hero whom thou seest Is the wide-ruling Agamemnon, son Of Atreus, and is both a gracious king And a most dreaded warrior. He was once »s Brother-in-law to me, if I may speak —</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lost as I am to shame — of such a tie." She said, the aged man admired, and then He spake again: "O son of Atreus, born Under a happy fate, and fortunate »*, Among the sons of men! A mighty host Of Grecian youths obey thy rule. I went To Phrygia once, — that land of vines, — and there Saw many Phrygians, heroes on fleet steeds, The troops of Otreus, and of Mygdon, shaped 23s Like one of the immortals. They encamped By the Sangarius. I was an ally; My troops were ranked with theirs upon the day When came the unsexed Amazons to war. Yet even there I saw not such a host 0» As this of black-eyed Greeks who muster here." Then Priam saw Ulysses, and inquired : — "Dear daughter, tell me also who is that, Less tall than Agamemnon, yet more brcad In chest and shoulders. On the teeming earth «s His armor lies, but he, from place to place, Walks round among the ranks of soldiery, As when the thick-fleeced father of the flocks Moves through the multitude of his white sheep." And Jove-descended Helen answered thus : — »s0 "That is Ulysses, man of many arts, Son of Laertes, reared in Ithaca, That rugged isle, and skilled in every form Of shrewd device and action wisely planned." Then spake the sage Antenor : " Thou hast said</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The truth, O lady. This Ulysses once Came on an embassy, concerning thee, To Troy with Menelaus, great in war; And I received them as my guests, and they Were lodged within my palace, and I learned The temper and the qualities of both. When both were standing 'mid the men of Troy, I marked that Menelaus's broad chest Made him the more conspicuous, but when both Were seated, greater was the dignity *,s Seen in Ulysses. When they both addressed The council, Menelaus briefly spake In pleasing tones, though with few words, — as one Not given to loose and wanderingspeech, —although The younger. When the wise Ulysses rose, *70 He stood with eyes cast down, and fixed on earthy And neither swayed his sceptre to the right Nor to the left, but held it motionless, Like one unused to public speech. He seemed An idiot out of humor. But when forth »7s He sent from his full lungs his mighty voice, And words came like a fall of winter snow, No mortal then would dare to strive with him For mastery in speech. We less admired The aspect of Ulysses than his words." Beholding Ajax then, the aged king Asked yet again: "Who is that other chief Of the Achaians, tall, and large of limb, — Taller and broader-chested than the rest?"</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Helen, the beautiful and richly-robed, »«s Answered: "Thou seest the mighty Ajax there, The bulwark of the Greeks. On the other side, Among his Cretans, stands Idomeneus, Of godlike aspect, near to whom are grouped The Jeaders of the Cretans. Oftentimes The warlike Menelaus welcomed him Within our palace, when he came from Crete. I could point out and name the other chiefs Of the dark-eyed Achaians. Two alone, Princes among their people, are not seen, — *« Castor the fearless horseman, and the skilled In boxing, Pollux, — twins; one mother bore Both them and me. Came they not with the rest From pleasant Lacedaemon to the war? Or, having crossed the deep in their good ships, 300 Shun they to fight among the valiant ones Of Greece, because of my reproach and shame?" She spake ; but they already lay in earth In Lacedaemon, their dear native land. And now the heralds through the city bore 30s The sacred pledges of the gods, — two lambs, And joyous wine, the fruit of Earth, within A goat-skin. One of them — Idasus — brought A glistening vase and golden drinking-cups, And summoned, in these words, the aged king:— 310 "Son of Laomedon, arise! The chiefs Who lead the Trojan knights and brazen-mailed Achaians pray thee to descend at once</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into the plain, that thou mayst ratify A faithful compact. Alexander now 31s And warlike Menelaus will contend With their long spears for Helen. She and all Her treasures are to be the conqueror's prize; While all the other Trojans, having made A faithful league of amity, shall dwell 3» On Ilium's fertile plain, and all the Greeks Return to Argos, famed for noble steeds, And to Achaia, famed for lovely dames." He spake, and Priam, shuddering, heard and bade The attendants yoke the horses to his car. v$ Soon were they yoked; he mounted first and drew The reins; Antenor took a place within The sumptuous car, and through the Scaean gates They guided the fleet coursers toward the field. Now when the twain had come where lay the hosts 33" Of Trojans and Achaians, down they stepped Upon the teeming earth, and went among The assembled armies. Quickly, as they came, Rose Agamemnon, king of men, and next Uprose the wise Ulysses. To the spot 33s The illustrious heralds brought the sacred things That bind a treaty, and with mingled wine They filled a chalice, and upon the hands Of all the kings poured water. Then the son Of Atreus drew a dagger which he wore w Slung by his sword's huge sheath, and clipped away</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The forelocks of the lambs, and parted them Among the Trojan and Achaian chiefs, And stood with lifted hands and prayed aloud :— "O Father Jupiter, who rulest all «s From Ida, mightiest, most august! and thou, O all-beholding and all-hearing Sun! Ye Rivers, and thou Earth, and ye who dwell Beneath the earth and punish after death Those who have sworn false oaths, bear witness ye, is0 And keep unbroken this day's promises. If Alexander in the combat slay My brother Menelaus, he shall keep Helen and all her wealth, while we return Homeward in our good ships. If, otherwise, 3ss The bright-haired Menelaus take the life Of Alexander, Helen and her wealth Shall be restored, and they of Troy shall pay Such fine as may be meet, and may be long Remembered in the ages yet to come. And then if, after Alexander's fall, Priam and Priam's sons refuse the fine, I shall make war for it, and keep my place By Troy until I gain the end I seek." So spake the king, and with the cruel steel 3«s Cut the lambs' throats, and laid them on the ground, Panting and powerless, for the dagger took Their lives away. Then over them they poured Wine from the chalice, drawn in golden cups, And prayed to the ever-living gods; and thus</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were Trojans and Achaians heard to say : — "0 Jupiter most mighty and august! Whoever first shall break these solemn oaths, So may their brains flow down upon the earth, — Theirs and their children's, — like the wine we pour, And be their wives the wives of other men." sr0 Such was the people's vow. Saturnian Jove Confirmed it not. Then Priam, of the line Of Dardanus, addressed the armies thus : — "Hear me, ye Trojans, and ye well-greaved Greeks! #0 For me I must return to wind-swept Troy. I cannot bear, with these old eyes, to look On my dear son engaged in desperate fight With Menelaus, the beloved of Mars. Jove and the ever-living gods alone 33s Know which of them shall meet the doom of death." So spake the godlike man, and placed the lambs Within his chariot, mounted, and drew up The reins. Antenor by him took his place Within the sumptuous chariot. Then they turned w, The horses and retraced their way to Troy. But Hector, son of Priam, and the great Ulysses measured off a fitting space, And in a brazen helmet, to decide Which warrior first should hurl the brazen spear, rn They shook the lots, while all the people round Lifted their hands to heaven and prayed the gods; And thus the Trojans and Achaians said:—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>"O Father Jove, who rulest from the top Of Ida, mightiest one and most august! *» Whichever of these twain has done the wrong, Grant that he pass to Pluto's dwelling, slain, While friendship and a faithful league are ours." So spake they. Hector of the beamy helm Looked back and shook the lots. Forth leaped at once *,s The lot of Paris. Then they took their seats In ranks beside their rapid steeds, and where Lay their rich armor. Paris the divine, Husband of bright-haired Helen, there put on His shining panoply, — upon his legs 410 Fair greaves, with silver clasps, and on his breast His brother's mail, Lycaon's, fitting well His form. Around his shoulders then he hung His silver-studded sword, and stout, broad shield, And gave his glorious brows the dreadful helm, 41s Dark with its horse-hair plume. A massive spear Filled his right hand. Meantime the warlike son Of Atreus clad himself in like array. And now when both were armed for fight, and each Had left his host, and, coming forward, walked a» Between the Trojans and the Greeks, and frowned Upon the other, a mute wonder held The Trojan cavaliers and well-greaved Greeks. There near each other in the measured space They stood in wrathful mood with lifted spears. «s First Paris hurled his massive spear; it smote</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The round shield of Atrides, but the brass Broke not beneath the blow ; the weapon's point Was bent on that strong shield. The next assault Atrides Menelaus made, but first 430 Offered this prayer to Father Jupiter : — "O sovereign Jove! vouchsafe that I avenge On guilty Paris wrongs which he was first To offer; let him fall beneath my hand, That men may dread hereafter to requite 43s The friendship of a host with injury." He spake, and flung his brandished spear; it smote The round shield of Priamides; right through The shining buckler went the rapid steel, And, cutting the soft tunic near the flank, 4« Stood fixed in the fair corselet. Paris bent Sideways before it and escaped his death. Atrides drew his silver studded sword, Lifted it high and smote his enemy's crest. The weapon, shattered to four fragments, fell. «3 He looked to the broad heaven, and thus ex- claimed : — "O Father Jove! thou art of all the gods The most unfriendly. I had hoped to avenge The wrong by Paris done me, but my sword Is broken in my grasp, and from my hand 's» The spear was vainly flung and gave no wound." He spake, and, rushing forward, seized the helm Of Paris by its horse-hair crest, and turned</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And dragged him toward the well-armed Greeks. Beneath His tender throat the embroidered band that held 4ss The helmet to the chin was choking him. And now had Menelaus dragged him thence, And earned great glory, if the child of Jove, Venus, had not perceived his plight in time. She broke the ox-hide band; an empty helm 4«0 Followed the powerful hand; the hero saw, Swung it aloft and hurled it toward the Greeks, And there his comrades seized it. He again Rushed with his brazen spear to slay his foe. But Venus — for a goddess easily *ss Can work such marvels—rescued him, and, wrapped In a thick shadow, bore him from the field And placed him in his chamber, where the air Was sweet with perfumes. Then she took her way To summon Helen. On the lofty tower 470 She found her, midst a throng of Trojan dames, And plucked her perfumed robe. She took the form And features of a spinner of the fleece, An aged dame, who used to comb for her The fair white wool in Lacedaemon's halls, 47s And loved her much. In such an humble guise The goddess Venus thus to Helen spake : — "Come hither, Alexander sends for thee; He now is in his chamber and at rest On his carved couch; in beauty and attire 4«0 Resplendent, not like one who just returns Page 84 84 The Iliad. From combat with a hero, but like one Who goes to mingle in the choral dance, Or, when the dance is ended, takes his seat." She spake, and Helen heard her, deeply moved; Yet when she marked the goddess's fair neck, Beautiful bosom, and soft, lustrous eyes, Her heart was touched with awe, and thus she said :— "Strange being! why wilt thou delude me still? Wouldst thou decoy me further on among w The populous Phrygian towns, or those that stud Pleasant Maeonia, where there haply dwells Some one of mortal race whom thou dost deign To make thy favorite. Hast thou seen, perhaps, That Menelaus, having overpowered *n The noble Alexander, seeks to bear Me, hated as I must be, to his home? And hast thou therefore fallen on this device? Go to him, sit by him, renounce for him The company of gods, and never more s90 Return to heaven, but suffer with him; watch Beside him till he take thee for his wife Or handmaid. Thither I shall never go, To adorn his couch and to disgrace myself. The Trojan dames would taunt me. O, the griefs s0s That press upon my soul are infinite!" Displeased, thegoddess Venusanswered :"Wretch, Incense me not, lest I abandon thee In anger, and detest thee with a zeal As great as is my love, and lest I cause</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Trojans and Greeks to hate thee, so that thou Shalt miserably perish." Thus she spake; And Helen, Jove-begotten, struck with awe, Wrapped in a robe of shining white, went forth In silence from amidst the Trojan dames, s•s Unheeded, for the goddess led the way. When now they stood beneath the sumptuous roof Of Alexander, straightway did the maids Turn to their wonted tasks, while she went up, Fairest of women, to her chamber. There s*, The laughing Venus brought and placed a seat Right opposite to Paris. Helen sat, Daughter of tegis-bearing Jove, with eyes Averted, and reproached her husband thus: — "Com'st thou from battle? Rather would that thou 3»s Hadst perished by the mighty hand of him Who was my husband. It was once, I know, Thy boast that thou wert more than peer in strength And power of hand, and practice with the spear, To warlike Menelaus. Go then now, s30 Defy him to the combat once again. And yet I counsel thee to stand aloof, Nor rashly seek a combat, hand to hand, With fair haired Menelaus, lest perchance He smite thee with his spear and thou be slain." sis Then Paris answered : "Woman, chide me not Thus harshly. True it is, that, with the aid Of Pallas, Menelaus hath obtained</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The victory; but I may vanquish him In turn, for we have also gods with us. m. Give we the hour to dalliance; never yet Have I so strongly proved the power of love, — Not even when 1 bore thee from thy home In pleasant Lacedaamon, traversing The deep in my good ships, and in the isle w: Of Cranae made thee mine, — such glow of love Possesses me, and sweetness of desire." He spake, and to the couch went up ; his wife Followed, and that fair couch received them both. Meantime Atrides, like a beast of prey, Went fiercely ranging through the crowd in search Of godlike Alexander. None of all The Trojans, or of their renowned allies, Could point him out to Menelaus, loved Of Mars; and had they known his lurking-place 3ss They would not for his sake have kept him hid, For like black death they hated him. Then stood Among them Agamemnon, king of men, And spake : "Ye Trojans and Achaians, hear, And ye allies. The victory belongs s«0 To warlike Menelaus. Ye will then Restore the Argive Helen and her wealth, And pay the fittmg fine, which shall remain A memory to men in future times." Thus spake the son of Atreus, and the rest s«s Of the Achaian host approved his words.</span>

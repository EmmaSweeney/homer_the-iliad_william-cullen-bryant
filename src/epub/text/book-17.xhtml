				<p>
					<span>THE warlike Menelaus, Atreus' son, Beheld Patroclus fall by Trojan hands, And came in glittering armor to the van To guard the body of the slain. As walks A heifer moaning round her new-born young, So fair-haired Menelaus stalked around The body of Patroclus, holding forth His spear and great round shield, intent to slay Whoever came against him. But the son Of Panthoiis, mighty spearman, not the less Intent to spoil the illustrious dead, drew near, And spake to warlike Menelaus thus : — "Atrides Menelaus, reared by Jove, And leader of thy host, give way and leave The dead, and quit to me his bloody spoil; For none of our brave Trojans and allies Smote him in deadly combat with the'spear, Before me. Leave me therefore to receive The glory due me from the sons of Troy, Else will I smite thee too, and thou wilt lose Thy precious life!" Indignant at the word, The fair-haired Menelaus answered him :— "O Father Jove! unseemly boasts are these! For not the panther's nor the lion's might, Nor that of the fierce forest-boar whose rage</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is heightened into fury, is as great As that which these distinguished spearmen, sons Of Panthous, utter with their lips. And yet The horseman Hyperenor did not long Enjoy his youth when he with insolent words Assailed me, and withstood me, — when he said That I was the most craven wretch who bore Arms in the Grecian host. He never turned, I think, his footsteps homeward to delight His reverend parents and beloved wife; And I, like his, will take thy life, if thou Oppose me. Heed my counsel, and withdraw Among the crowd, and so avoid my stroke Before thou come to harm. He is a fool Who only sees the mischiefs that are past." He said : Euphorbus, heeding not his words Of warning, spake again : "Now is my time, Jove-nurtured Menelaus, to avenge My brother, slain by thee, and over whom Thou utteredst such swelling words, whose wife In her new bridal chamber thou hast made A widow, and upon her parents brought Mourning and endless sorrow. It may make The sorrow less, should I into the hands Of Panthous and the noble Phrontis give Thy head and armor. Let us now delay The strife no longer : it will show with whom The valor dwells, and who is moved by fear." He spake, and smote his enemy's round shield,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But pierced it not; the stubborn metal turned n The weapon's point. Then Menelaus, son Of Atreus, with a prayer to Jupiter, Struck, as Euphorbus made a backward step, His throat, and drave the weapon with strong hand Through the soft neck. He fell with clashing arms. His locks, which were like those the Graces wear, « And ringlets, bound with gold and silver bands, Were drenched with blood. As when some hus- bandman Rears in a lonely and well-watered spot An olive-tree with widely spreading boughs, «s Beautiful with fresh shoots, and putting forth White blossoms, gently waved by every wind, A sudden blast descends with mighty sweep And tears it from its bed, and lays it prone Upon the earth, — so lay Euphorbus, skilled jo To wield the spear and son of Panthoiis, slain And spoiled by Menelaus, Atreus' son. As when a lion of the mountain wilds, Fearless and strong, bears from the browsing herd The fairest of the kine, and breaks her neck 7s With his strong teeth, and, tearing her, devours The bloody entrails, while a clamorous throng Of dogs and herdsmen, with incessant cries, Gather around him, yet approach him not, Withheld by fear, so of the warriors round so The gallant Menelaus none could find The courage to encounter him ; and then</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Atrides easily had borne away The sumptuous armor worn by Panthous' son, If envious Apollo had not moved Hector to meet him. Putting on the form Of Mentes, chief of the Ciconian band, He said to him aloud, with winged words : —. "Hector, thou art pursuing what thy feet Will never overtake, the steeds which draw The chariot of Achilles. Hard it were For mortal man to tame them or to guide, Save for Achilles, goddess-born. Meanwhile Hath warlike Menelaus, Atreus' son, Guarding the slain Patroclus, overthrown Etiphorbus, bravest of the Trojan host, A son of Panthous ; he will fight no more." Thus spake the god, and disappeared among The warring squadrons. Bitter was the grief That seized the heart of Hector as he looked Along the ranks and saw the Greek bear off The sumptuous arms, and saw the Trojan lie Weltering in blood. At once he made his way To the front rank, all armed in glittering brass, And with loud shouts. As terrible he came As Vulcan's inextinguishable fires. The son of Atreus heard that mighty shout, \nd thus to his great soul lamenting said :— "If I abandon these rich spoils and leave Patroclus, who has perished in my cause, I fear the Greeks will look upon the act</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With indignation. If, through dread of shame, I fight alone with Hector and' his men, I fear to be o'erwhelmed by multitudes, For crested Hector leads the whole array Of Trojans hither. Yet why question thus? For when a warrior ventures to assault One whom a god protects, a bitter doom Is his. Then none of all the Greeks should blame If I give way to Hector, whom a god ,*, Hath sent against me. Yet could I but hear The voice of mighty Ajax, we would both Return, and even against a god renew The combat, that we haply might restore Patroclus to Achilles, Peleus' son. ^ Such in this choice of evils were the least." As thus he mused, the men of Troy came on, With Hector at their head. The Greek gave way And left the slain. As when a lion, driven With pikes and clamor from the herdsman's stalls ,» By men and dogs, unwillingly retreats, His valiant heart still raging in his breast, So did the fair-haired Menelaus leave Patroclus. When he 'reached the Grecian ranks, He turned and stood and looked about to find ,a The mighty Ajax, son of Telamon, And him he soon beheld on the left edge Of battle, rallying there and heartening His men ; for Phoebus from above had sent A panic fear among them. To him then</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The son of Atreus went in haste and said : — "Ajax, my friend, come hither where we fight Around Patroclus. Let us strive at least To bring Achilles back the hero's corpse, Though stripped ; for crested Hector hath his arms." He spake ; the courage of the warlike son i«s Of Telamon was kindled by his words. To the front rank he hastened, and with him Went fair-haired Menelaus. Hector there Had spoiled Patroclus of his glorious arms, 1s0 And now was dragging him apart to hew The head away with his keen sword, and give The body to the dogs of Troy. Just then Came Ajax, bearing, like a tower, his shield, And Hector mingled with the Trojan ranks, im And leaped mto his car; but first he gave His friends the glittering spoil to bear away To Troy, — a glory to the conqueror; While Ajax, over Menoetiades Holding his ample shield, stood firm as stands t*, A lion o'er his whelps, when, as he comes Leading them through the wood, the hunters rush Upon him, and his look is terrible As his knit eyebrows cover his fierce eyes. So Ajax moved around the hero's corpse, 1«s While warlike Menelaus by his side, The son of Atreus, stood in bitter grief. Then with a look of anger, Glaucus spake — Son of Hippolochus, and chief among</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Lycians — thus to Hector: "Though thy form, i7» Hector, be noble, yet in prowess thou Art wanting, and thy fame in feats of war Is not deserved, since thou dost fly the foe. Think whether thou alone, with others born In Troy, canst save the city and the state. ,7s For henceforth will no Lycian fight for Troy Against the Greeks; this conflict without end Has never earned them thanks. Inglorious chief! How wilt thou be the shield of humbler men, If thou canst leave Sarpedon, who has been Thy comrade and thy guest, to be the prey And spoil of the Greek warriors? While he lived, Great was the aid he brought thy cause and thee, And now thou dost not seek to drive away The dogs from his neglected corpse. For this, ««s If any of the Lycians heed my words, They will go home, and imminent will be The ruin of thy city. If that firm And resolute valor lived in Trojan hearts Which they should cherish who in the defence ,*, Of their own country bear the toils and face The dangers of the field, we might this hour Drag off the slain Patroclus into Troy. And should we bear him from the thick of fight To the great city of Priam, soon the Greeks Would let us ransom the rich armor worn By our Sarpedon, and bring back his corpse;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For he lies slain who was the bosom friend Of the most valiant chieftain at the fleet Of Greece and leader of her bravest men. ™ But thou, when great-souled Ajax fixed his eye Upon thee, didst not venture to remain And fight with him; he is more brave than thou." The crested Hector frowned and thus replied : — « Why, Glaucus, should a warrior such as thou »0s Utter such violent words? My friend, I deemed That thou wert wise above all other men Of fertile Lycia, but I now must blame Thy judgment when thou say'st I shrink to meet The mighty Ajax. I do neither dread ™, The battle's fury nor the rush of steeds; But all prevailing are the purposes Of agis-bearing Jove, who makes the brave To flee, and takes from him the victory, And then again impels him to the fight. »is Come then, my friend, stand by me ; see if I Skulk this time from the conflict, as thou say'st, Or tame the courage of whatever Greek, The bravest, who defends Patroclus slain." He spake, and, shouting, cheered the Trojans on: "Trojans and Lycians and Dardanians, trained « To combat hand to hand, let it be seen, My friends, that ye are men, and still retain Your ancient valor; while I buckle on The glorious armor of the illustrious son »s Of Peleus, taken from Patroclus slain."</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So spake the crested Hector, and withdrew From the fierce conflict, and with rapid steps O'ertook his comrades as they bore away Townward the glorious arms of Peleus' son. «s» There from that deadly strife apart he stood, And changed his coat of mail. He gave his own To his companions, to be carried thence To sacred Ilium, and he buckled on The immortal armor of Achilles, son va Of Feleus, which the gods of heaven bestowed Upon his father, who in his old age Consigned them to Achilles; but the son Was never in that armor to grow old. And when the Cloud-compeller Jove beheld a*, Hector apart, accoutred in the arms Of Peleus' godlike son, he shook his head, And to himself he said: "Unhappy man! Death even now is near to thee, and yet Is not in all thy thoughts. Thou puttest on «s The heavenly armor of the terrible chief, Before whom others tremble; thou hast slain His friend, the brave and gentle, and hast stripped, To do him shame, the armor from his limbs. Yet will I for the moment give to thee Fresh triumphs, since Andromache shall ne'er Receive, when thou returnest from the field, The armor of Pelides from thy hands." The son of Saturn spake, and gave the nod With his dark brows. Well did that coat of mail</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Suit Hector's form. Meantime the god of war In all his fierceness entered Hector's breast: Fresh vigor filled and nerved his frame; he went Along the ranks of his renowned allies With shouts; that glittering armor made him seem »*, The large-souled son of Peleus. To them all He spake in turn, encouraging their hearts,— To Mesthles, Glaucus, and Thersilochus, Medon, Deisenor, and Hippothoiis, Asleropseus, Phorcys, Chromius, *s And Ennomus the Augur; these the chief Exhorted to the fight with winged words : — "Hear me, ye mighty throng of our allies, Dwellers of nations round us! Not to make Our army vast in numbers did I send »70 To summon you, each from his native town, But that your willing valor might defend The wives and children of the sons of Troy From the assailing Greeks. I therefore give Most freely of our substance in large gifts 17s And banquets, that ye all may be content; And now let some of you move boldly on To do or die, which is the chance of war. To him who from the field will drag and bring The slain Patroclus to the Trojan knights, *, Compelling Ajax to give way, — to him I yield up half the spoil ; the other half I keep, and let his glory equal mine." He spake, and all that mighly multitude</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With lifted lances threw themselves against »«5 The Grecian ranks. They hoped to bear away The dead from Ajax, son of Telamon. Ah, idle hope! that hero o'er the dead Took many a Trojan's life. Then Ajax thus To Menelaus, great in battle, spake :— »90 "O friend, O Menelaus, reared by Jove, No longer now I hope our safe return From battle. Not the greatest of my fears Is for Patroclus, whom the dogs of Troy And birds of prey full quickly will devour, *&gt;i But for my life and thine. That cloud of war, Hector, o'ershadows all, and over us Impends the doom of death. Yet let us call Our mighty men, if they perchance may hear." He spake, and Menelaus, great in war, 390 Obeyed his wish and shouted to the Greeks : — "O friends, the princes and the chiefs of Greece, Who at the public feasts with Atreus' sons — King Agamemnon and his brother chief— Drink wine, — who each command a host, and hold Your honors and your state from Jove, — my eyes Cannot discern you in the thick of fight; But some of you, who cannot bear to leave Patroclus to the dogs of Troy, draw near!" He spake; Oilean Ajax, swift of foot, ?10 Heard and came forward, hastening through the fight; And after him Idomeneus, who brought</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Meriones, his armor-bearer, fierce As the man-slayer Mars. But who could tell The names of all the other Greeks that sprang sis To mingle in the strife? The Trojans made The first assault, and Hector led them on. As at the mouth of some great river, swoln By rains from Jove, the mighty ocean-wave Meets it with roaring, and the cliffs around »*, Rebellow, while the surges toss without, With such a clamor came the Trojans on, While round Patroclus closed, with one accord, The Greeks, protected by their brazen shields, And o'er their shining helmets Saturn's son m Poured darkness. For when Menoetiades Yet lived, attendant upon Peleus' son, Jove looked on him with no unkind regard, And now he would not that his corse should feed The enemy's dogs, and therefore moved his friends To rescue him. At first the Trojans drave 33. The dark-eyed Greeks before them; back they fell And left the dead ; yet, fiercely as they came, The Trojans slew no man, but dragged away The dead. A moment, and no more, the Greeks 33s Fell back ; for Ajax quickly rallied them,— Ajax, who, next to Peleus' valiant son, Excclled them all in form and feats of war; He through the foremost warriors brak », as strong As a wild bear that on the mountain's side 3« Breaks through the shrubs, and scatters with a bound</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A band of youths and dogs. The illustrious son Of honored Telamon thus put to rout The Trojan phalanxes environing Pairoclus, in the hope to bear him thence ms Townward with glory. There Hippothoiis, son Of Lethus the Pelasgian, having bound A thong about the sinewy ankle, toiled To drag away the slain man by the foot From that fierce strife, — a grateful spectacle ss» To Hector and the Trojans. Yet on him A vengeance which no friendly arm could ward Fell suddenly. The son of Telamon Rushed through the crowd, and in close combat smote His helmet's brazen cheek. That plumed helm 3ss Was cleft by the huge spear and vigorous hand, And where the weapon struck Hippothoiis, Mingled with blood the brain gushed forth; the life Forsook his limbs; he dropped from nerveless hands The foot of brave Patroclus, and beside *» The corpse fell headlong, — far from the rich fields Of his Larissa, never to repay With gentle cares in their old age the love Of his dear parents; for his life was short, Slain by the spear of Ajax, large of soul. #s Then Hector aimed again his shining spear At Ajax, who perceived it as it came, And just avoided it. The weapon struck Schedius, the valiant son of Iphitus,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bravest of the Phocians, whose abode 370 Was Panopeus the famous, where he ruled O'er many men. Beneath the collar-bone It pierced him, and passed through; the brazen point Came out upon the shoulder; to the ground He fell, his armor clashing with his fall. r.i Then Ajax smote the valiant Phorcys, son Of Phoenops, in the navel. Through the mail The brazen weapon broke, and roughly tore The entrails. In the dust he fell, and clenched The earth with dying hands. The foremost ranks, Led by illustrious Hector, at the sight i»i Yielded the ground; the Greeks with fearful shouts Dragged off the bodies of Hippothoiis And Phorcys, and despoiled them of their arms. Then would the Trojans have been put to flight sss Before the warlike Greeks, and, craven like, Gone up to Troy, and great had been the fame Gained by the might and courage of the Greeks, Beyond what Jupiter designed to give, Had not Apollo brought .^neas forth s» By putting on the form of Periphas, The herald and the son of Epytus, Who in that office as a prudent friend And counsellor had served, till he grew old, The father of ^Eneas. In his shape jsa Thus spake Apollo, son of Jupiter : — "/Eneas, ye might even hold the towers</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of lofty Ilium safe against a god, Were ye to act as some whom I have seen, — Valiant, and confident in their own might And multitude of dauntless followers. And now Jove favors us and offers us The victory o'er the Greeks, and yet ye flee In abject terror, and refuse to fight." He spake; /Eneas, looking at him, knew The archer-god, and with a mighty voice Called out to Hector: "Hector! thou and all Who lead the troops of Troy, and our allies, Great shame it were if we were put to rout Before the warlike Greeks, and beaten back To Troy like cowards. Standing by my side, One of the gods already hath declared That Jupiter, All-wise, is our ally In battle. Let us therefore boldly fall Upon the Greeks, nor suffer them to bear Patroclus unmolested to their fleet." He spake, and, springing to the foremost rani Stood firm; the Trojans also turned and faced The Achaians. Then /Eneas with his spear Struck down Leocritus, the gallant friend Of Lycomedes and Arisbas' son. The warlike Lycomedes saw his fall With grief, and came and cast his shining spear At Apisaon, son of Hippasus, A shepherd of the people. Underneath The midriff, through the liver went the spear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he fell lifeless. He had come to Troy From rich Pseonia, and was great in war, Next to Asteropaeus. As he saw His comrade fall, Asteropaeus, moved »*, By grief, advanced to combat with the Greeks, Hut could not; for the group that stood around Patroclus showed a fence of shields, and held Their spears before them. Ajax moved among The warriors, charging them that none should leave The corpse, and none should step beyond the rest To strike the foe, but stay to guard the dead, And combat hand to hand. Such was the charge Of mighty Ajax. All the earth around Was steeped with blood, and many a corpse was heaped 4*, On corpse of Trojans and their brave allies, And of the Greeks, for even on their side The strife was not unbloody, though of Greeks There perished fewer; each was on the watch To ward the battle's dangers from the rest. us Then did they fight like fire. You could not say The sun was safe, nor yet the moon, so thick A darkness gathered over the brave men Around the corpse of Menoetiades. The other Trojans and the well-armed Greeks »s0 Fought freely under the clear sky; the sun Shed o'er them his full brightness; not a cloud Shadowed the earth, or rested on the hills. From time to time they paused, and warily</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They shunned each other's cruel darts, and kept 43 Far from each other, while in the mid-war Struggled the combatants in darkness, galled By the remorseless weapons of their foes. Vet Thrasymedes and Antilochus, Two famous Grecian warriors, had not learned That excellent Patroclus was no more, But thought that, still alive, he led the war Against the Trojans, fighting in the van. They watched the flight and slaughter of the Greeks, And fought apart, for Nestor so enjoined, Who sent them to the battle from the fleet. But they who held the middle space around The friend of swift .-Eacides, maintained A desperate strife all day; the knees, the thighs, The feet, the hands, the eyes of those who fought 470 Were faint with weariness and foul with sweat. As when an ample ox-hide, steeped in fat, Is given to workmen to be stretched, they stand Around it in a circle, pulling it, Till forth the moisture issues, and the oil «ts Enters the skin, and by that constant strain From many hands the hide is duly stretched, So in small space the warriors drew the dead Hither and thither; they of Ilium strove To drag it to the city, they of Greece To bear it to the fleet. The tumult then Was terrible, and neither Mars himself, The musterer of hosts, nor Pallas, roused</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To htr intensest wrath, had they been near The struggle, would have seen it with disdain. at Such deadly strife of steeds and men was held O'er slain Patroclus by the will of Jove. The great Achilles knew not yet the fate Of his Patroclus, for the warriors fought Far from the fleet, beside the wall of Troy. 490 He never thought of him as one whose death Was near, but trusted that, when once he reached The Trojan wall, he would return alive; Nor ever deemed he that without his aid, Or even with it, would Patroclus sack 49s The city. This was what he oft had heard From Thetis, who disclosed to him apart The counsel of Almighty Jupiter. Yet had his mother never once revealed The present evil, — that the one whom most *» He loved of all his friends should perish thus. Still round the dead they fought with their keen spears, And slew each other. Then of the mailed Greeks Some one would say: "O friends, it were disgrace Should we fall back upon our roomy ships. s»s First let the dark earth swallow us; for this Were better than to let tie Trojan knights Drag off the dead in triumph to their town." And some among the large-souled sons of Troy Would say: "O friends, though all of us should fall Beside this corpse, let no one turn and flee."</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus they, encouraging each other, spake, And thus the fight went on. The iron din Rose through the waste air to the brazen heaven. Meantime aloof from battle stood the steeds s,s Of Peleus' son, and sorrowed when they knew That he who guided them lay stretched in dust By Hector's slaughtering hand. Automedon, The brave son of Diores, often tried The lash, and gentle words as oft, and oft s ° Shouted forth threats; yet neither would they move Toward the broad Hellespont, where lay the fleet, Nor toward the Greeks in combat, but remained Motionless as a funeral column, reared To mark a man's or woman's tomb. So stood s»s The coursers yoked to that magnificent car, With drooping heads, and tears that from their lids Flowed hot, for sorrow at the loss of him Who was their charioteer, and their fair manes, Sweeping the yoke below, were foul with dust. 330 The son of Saturn saw their grief, and shook His head in pity, saying to himself: — "Why did the gods bestow you, luckless pair, On Peleus, — on a king of mortal birth, — You who shall never feel old age or death? s3s Was it that ye might share with human-kind Their sorrows? for the race of mortal men Of all that breathe and move upon the earth Is the most wretched. Yet of this be sure, — That ye shall never in that sumptuous car</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bear Hector. Is it not enough that he Should wear that armor, uttering idle boasts? And now will I infuse into your limbs Spirit and strength, that ye may safely bear Automedon across the battle-field s4s To where the roomy galleys lie. I yet Must give more glory to the men of Troy, And they must slay until they come again To the good ships of Greece, — until the sun Goes down and sacred darkness covers all." s* So spake the god, and breathed into the steeds New life and vigor. From their manes they shook The dust, and flew with that swift car among The Greeks and Trojans. With the Trojan throng, Automedon, though mourning his slain friend, s3s Maintained the fight; he rushed upon their ranks, A vulture pouncing on a flock of geese. Swiftly he passed from out the Trojan throng; Swiftly again he charged their phalanxes In fierce pursuit. Yet slew he none of those Whom he pursued; he could not guide at once The steeds and cast the spear, when seated thus Alone within that sacred car. At last A friend, the valorous Alcimedon, Laerces' son, of /Emon's line, beheld s«s His plight, and, standing near his chariot, said : — "What god, Automedon, hath prompted thee To these mad acts, and stolen thy better sense, Fighting alone among the foremost ranks</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Trojan warriors, thy companion slain, s7° And Hector in the field, who boastfully Stalks in the armor of /Eacides?" And thus Automedon, Diores' son, Made answer: "Who is there among the Greeks Able like thee, Alcimedon, to rein s7s And curb the spirit of immortal steeds? None were there save Patroclus while he lived, Wise as a god in council. Death and fate Now hold him. To thy hand I give the lash And shining reins, while I descend and fight." s«0 He spake, and into his swift chariot sprang Alcimedon, and took the lash and reins. Automedon leaped down. As Hector saw, He thus bespake ^Eneas at his side :— "/Eneas, leader of the men of Troy, s«s Equipped in brazen armor, I have seen Those coursers of the swift /Eacides Driven through the battle by unwarlike hands, And't is my hope, if thou wilt give thine aid, To seize them. They who guide them will not dare To stand and face us when we make the charge." s5, He spake; Anchises' valiant son complied, And, sheltered by their shields of tough ox-hide, Well dried and firm, and strong with plates of brass, The twain went forward. With them at their side s9s Went Chromius and Aretus, nobly formed, In hope to lead away the high-necked steeds, Their guardians slain. Vain dreamers! they were doomed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not without bloody penance to return From that encounter with Automedon, Who prayed to Father Jove, and whose faint heart Was strengthened and made bold. And thus thechiel Said to his faithful friend Alcimedon :—- "Keep not the steeds thou guidest far from me, Alcimedon, but let them ever breathe *s Upon my shoulders. Hector, Priam's son, I think, will not give over this assault Before he either slays us, and ascends The car to which these steeds with flowing manes Are yoked, and puts to flight the phalanxes «10 Of Argive warriors, or himself is slain." He spake, and called to both the Ajaxes And Menelaus: "Ye who lead the Greeks," He said, and named the chieftains, "give in charge The dead to your best warriors, to surround And guard the corpse, and drive away the foe; But hasten to avert the evil day From us who are alive. For even now Hector comes rushing through the deadly fight, And brings ^F.neas; these are the most brave Of all the Trojan army. On the knees Of the great gods the issue rests. I too Will cast the spear, and leave the rest to Jove." He spake, and lifting his huge spear he smote The round shield of Aretus. There the blade Stopped not, but, entering, pierced him through the belt.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As, when a vigorous youth with a keen axe Strikes a wild bull behind the horns, and there Severs the sinews, forward leaps the beast And falls, — Aretus, springing forward thus, «j, Fell headlong. In the Trojan's entrails still Quivered the spear, and life forsook his limbs. Then Hector aimed, to smite Automedon, His shining spear. The Greek beheld and stooped, And shunned the brazen weapon. Down it came, «33 And plunged into the earth, and stood, its stem Still shaken with the blow, and spent its force. Now would the twain have turned, and hand to hand Fought with their swords, when suddenly came up The warriors Ajax, hastening, at the" call «*, Of their companion, through the crowd, and stayed The combat. Hector and /Eneas then, And Chromius, of the godlike form, withdrew Through caution, leaving on the battle field Aretus lying mangled. The fierce chief (*s Automedon despoiled the dead, and spake Boastfully: "Somewhat lighter on my heart Lies now my grief for Menoetiades, Though I have slain a man of meaner note." As thus he spake, he threw the bloody spoils Into his chariot, mounting to the seat, His feet and hands all crimson with the blood, As when a lion has devoured an ox. . Then round Patroclus raged the strife again, Murderous and sad to see; for Pallas there</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Inflamed the strife, sent down from heaven by Jove, To rouse the courage of the Greeks, since such Was now his will. As when the god displays To men a purple rainbow in the skies, A sign of war or of a bitter storm, «0 Which drives the laborer from his task, and makes The cattle droop, so, in a purple cloud Concealed, she went among the Greeks, and filled Their hearts with valor. Taking first the form Of Phoenix, and his clear, unwearied voice, «s She spake in stirring words to Atreus' son, The gallant Menelaus, standing near: "Shame and dishonor will it be to thee, O Menelaus, if, beneath the walls Of Troy, the hungry dogs should tear the corpse «70 Of him who was in life the faithful friend Of great Achilles. Fight thou therefore on Bravely, and bid the other Greeks be brave." And Menelaus, great in war, rejoined: "O Phoenix, aged father, who wert born «75 In days long past, would but Minerva give The needed strength, and ward from me the stroke Of weapons, then would I stand by and guard Patroclus, for his death hath filled my heart With grief. But Hector's rage is like the rage « Of fire; he ceases not to slay; for Jove Gives to his spear the glory of the day." He spake, and well was blue-eyed Pallas pleased That first to her of all the deities</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He prayed ; and therefore did she nerve his chest «s And knees with strength, and put into his heart The daring of the fly, that, often driven From man, returns and bites, and finds how sweet Is human blood. Such resolute zeal she woke In his stern soul, as quickly he approached Patroclus, and sent forth his shining spear. Among the Trojans was Eetion's son, Podes, the rich and brave, whom Hector held In highest honor, choosing him to be Companion of his feasts. Him in the waist 9s The fair-haired Menelaus, as he fled, Smote, driving home the weapon. With a clash He fell to earth, and Menelaus drew The slain away among the Grecian ranks. Then came Apollo, putting on the form r~ Of Phaenops, son of Asius, whose abode Was in Abydos, and whom Hector most Esteemed of all his guests. The archer-god Drew near to Hector, and bespake him thus : — "Hector, what other Greek will fear thee now, 70s Since thou dost shrink from Menelaus, deemed Effeminate in war? Behold, he drags Away a warrior from thy host; his hand Hath slain thy faithful friend, Eetion's son, Brave Podes, fighting in the foremost ranks." He spake: a cloud of sorrow overspread The soul of Hector. Armed in glittering brass, He went among the warriors in the van.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then did the son of Saturn lift on high His fringed aegis, gleaming; with a cloud 71s He covered Ida, sent his lightnings down, And thundered terribly, and made the mount Shake to its base, and gave the victory To Troy, and put to rout the Grecian host . Peneleus of Bueotia led the fight . i*, A spear that lighted on the shoulder-tip, As he came forward, wounded him. The blade, Hurled by Polydamas in close assault, Entered and grazed the bone. Then Hector pierced The wrist of Leitus, Alectryon's son, ns And made him leave the combat. As he fled He looked around in fear, nor hoped again To wield the spear against the men of Troy. As Hector followed Leitus, he met The long spear of tdomeneus, which struck 7}, His corselet near the pap; the weapon broke Sheer at the socket, and the Trojans raised A shout, while Hector at Idomeneus Let fly his spear. It missed the chief, but smote Coeranus, who from pleasant Lyctus came, 73s The friend and follower of Meriones. For on that day Idomeneus had come From his good ships on foot, and great had been The triumph of the Trojans at his fall, If Coeranus had not with his swift steeds 740 Passed near and bid him mount. 'Twas thus he came</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To save Idomeneus from death, and yield To the man-queller Hector his own life; The javelin entered underneath the ear, By the jaw-bone, where, forcing out the teeth, ms It cleft the tongue in twain. He fell to earth, And dropped the reins. Meriones stooped down And took them from the dust in his own hands, And thus bespake Idomeneus: "Ply well The lash, until thy coursers reach the fleet, 7s0 For thou mayst clearly see that victory To-day is not upon the Grecian side." He spake: Idomeneus, fear-smitten, lashed The long-maned steeds that hurried toward the fleet. Nor now did Menelaus nor his friend, 7ss The valiant Ajax, fail to see that Jove Had changed the vantage to the side of Troy. And thus the son of Telamon beg.in : — "Alas! the feeblest mind can now perceive That Father Jove is with the sons of Troy, 7* And gives to them the glory of the day. Their weapons smite, whoever sends them forth, Coward or brave, for Jove directs them all; Ours fall to earth in vain. But let us now Consult how best to bear the corpse away, 7»s And how, returning, we may meet our friends With joy; for they are grieved as they behold Our plight, and fear that we may not withstand The fiery onset and invincible arm Of the man-queller Hector. Would there were</span>
					<br/>
					<span>^ome comrade who would bear to Peleus' son The tidings of the day! for he, I think, Has not yet heard that his dear friend is slain. None such can I behold of all the Greeks, For they are shrouded all — their steeds and they — tn darkness. Father Jove, deliver us From darkness; clear the heavens and give our eyes Again to see. Destroy ue if thou wilt, But O destroy us in the light of day!" He spake: the All-Father saw him shedding tears, And pitied him, and bade the shadows flee, 7«1 And swept away the cloud. The sun looked forth, And all the battle lay in light. Then thus To warlike Menelaus Ajax said :— "O Menelaus, foster-child of Jove, t% Look round and see if yet Antilochus, The large-souled son of Nestor, is alive, And bid him bear the tidings in all haste To the great son of Peleus, that the one Of all his friends whom most he loved is slain." 7w, He spake, and Menelaus, great in war, Complied, and hastened forth, as from a fold A lion stalks away, that long has kept In fear the hounds and herdsmen, who all night Have watched to drive him from their well-fed beeves, jw While, eager for his prey, he rushes oft Against them, but in vain, for mnny a spear Is hurled at him, and many a blazing brand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which, fierce for ravin as he is, he dreads, Till sullenly at early mom he goes. e90 So from Patroclus went unwillingly The valiant Menelaus, for he feared Lest, panic-struck, the Greeks should leave his corpse The enemy's prey. Thus earnestly he prayed The warriors Ajax and Meriones :— sos "Ye warriors Ajax, leaders of the Greeks! And thou, Meriones! let each of you Bear well in mind how kindly was the mood Of poor Patroclus; gentle in his life Was he to all, and now is with the dead." s.o The fair-haired Menelaus, speaking thus, Withdrew. He looked around him as he went, As looks an eagle, bird of sharpest sight — So men declare — of all the fowls of air, From which, though high in heaven, the nimble hare Beneath the thicket is not hid; he stoops, s,« And takes the creature's life. Thy piercing eyes, O Menelaus, thus on every side Were turned, in eager scrutiny, to find Among the multitude of Greeks the son *•» Of Nestor living. Him he soon descried Upon the battle's left, where manfully He cheered his fellows on. The fair-haired son Of Atreus came and stood by him, and said:— "Stay, foster-child of Jove, Antilochus! «»s And listen to the sorrowful news I bring</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of what should ne'er have been. Thou must have well Perceived, I think, that some divinity Doth heap disaster on our host, and give The victory to the Trojans. He is dead, — »*, Patroclus, — the most valiant of the Greeks, And great their sorrow is. Now hasten thou To the Greek galleys; let Achilles know The tidings; he may haply bring the corpse, Stripped as it is, unmangled to the fleet, B3s For crested Hector has the arms he wore." He spake, and at his words Antilochus Was horror-struck; in grief too great for speech, Tears filled his eyes, and his clear voice was choked. Yet heeded he the mandate. Laying off «« His arms, he gave them to his blameless friend, Laodocus, who with his firm-paced steeds Came toward him. Thus prepared he ran; his feet Carried him swiftly from the battle-field To bear the evil news to Peleus' son. «4s Yet Menelaus, foster-child of Jove, Thy spirit did not prompt thee to remain And aid thy hard-pressed comrades at the spot Whence thou didst send Antilochus, and where The Pyleans longed to keep him. Yet he sent The noble Thrasymedes to their aid, While he returned to where Patroclus lay, And stood beside the warriors there, and said:— "I sent to swift Achilles at the fleet</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A messenger, yet think he will not come. h&gt; Though royal Hector's deed hath roused his rage, Unarmed he cannot meet the sons of Troy. Consult we then how we may best convey The body to the ships, and how ourselves Escape the doom of death by Trojan hands." oso The mighty Ajax, son of Telamon, Replied: "O Menelaus far-renowned, Well hast thou spoken. Lift thou now the corse, Thou and Meriones, and place yourselves Beneath it, and convey it from the field. »s We, following you, will combat with the sons Of Troy and noble Hector, — we who, named Alike and one in spirit, oft have borne The fury of the battle side by side." He ended, and the warriors in their arms Raised with main strength the body from the ground. The Trojans, as they saw it borne away, Shouted behind them, rushing on like hounds That spring upon a wounded forest-boar Before the hunter-youths now pressing close »7s Upon his flank, to tear him, then again, Whene'er he turns upon them in his strength, Retreating in dismay, and put to flight Hither and thither. Thus, in hot pursuit And close array, the Trojans following strook With swords and two-edged spears; but when the twain Turned and stood firm to meet them, every cheek</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Grew pale, and not a single Trojan dared Draw near the Greeks to combat for the corse. Thus rapidly they bore away the dead »s Toward their good galleys from the battle-field. Onward with them the furious battle swept, As spreads a fire that, kindled suddenly, Seizes a city, and the dwellings sink In the consuming blaze, and a strong wind *» Roars through the flame. Such fearful din of steeds And warriors followed the retreating Greeks. As from a mountain summit strong-backed mules Drag over the rough ways a ponderous beam Or mast, till weary with the mighty strain «9s And streaming sweat, so they with resolute toil Bore off the dead. Behind them as they went Their two defenders kept the foe aloof. As when a river-dike o'ergrown with trees Crosses a plain, and holds the violent course 900 Of the swoln stream in check, and, driving back The waters, spreads them o'er the level fields, Nor can their fury force a passage through,— So did the warriors Ajax hold in check The Trojans; yet they followed close, and two 90s More closely than the rest, — /Eneas, son Of old Anchises, and the illustrious chief, Hector. As when a company of daws Or starlings, startled at a hawk's approach, The murderous enemy of the smaller birds, 910 Talc*- wing with piercing cries, so, driven before</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The might of Hector and /Eneas, fled The Greeks with clamorous cries, and thought no more Of combat. In the trench and near it lay Many fair weapons, which the fugitive Greeks s,s Had dropped in haste, and still the war went on.</span>

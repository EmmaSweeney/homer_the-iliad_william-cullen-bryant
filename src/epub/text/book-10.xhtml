				<p>
					<span>All the night long the captains of the Greeks Slept at the ships, and pleasant was their sleep, — Save only Agamemnon, Atreus' son, The shepherd of the people. Not to him — Vexed with a thousand cares — came gentle sleep.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As when the husband of the light-haired queen « Of heaven sends forth his thunders, ushering in Some wide-involving shower, — rain, hail, or snow Whitening the fields, — or opening o'er some land The ravenous jaws of unrelenting war, — u So frequent were the groans which from his heart Atrides uttered ; for within his breast His heart was troubled. Looking toward the plain Of Troy, he wondered at the many fires Blazing before the city, and the sound is 'Of flutes and fifes, and tumult of the crowd. But when he turned him toward the fleet and host Of Greece, he tore his hair, and flung it up To Jove, and vented his great heart in groans. And now at length it seemed to him most wise *, To seek Neleian Nestor, and with him Devise some plan by which to turn aside The threatened evil from the Greeks. He rose, And drew his tunic o'er his breast, and laced The graceful sandals to his well-shaped feet; »s And o'er his shoulders threw the blood-stained hide Of a huge tawny lion, that reached down Even to the ground ; and took in hand his spear. Meantime with like uneasy thoughts oppressed Was Menelaus, to whose eyes there came s° No slumber, — dreading lest calamity Should light upon the Greeks, who for his sake Had crossed the sea to carry war to Troy. And first he threw a leopard's spotted hide</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O'er his broad back, and placed the brazen helm u Upon his head, and took in his strong grasp A spear, and went to bid his brother wake, — His brother, the chief ruler over all The men of Greece, and honored like a god. He found him at his galley's prow in act *, To sheath his shoulders in the shining mail, And pleased to greet his coming. To the king Thus Menelaus, great in battle, spake : — "Why arm thyself, my brother? Wouldst thou send A warrior to explore the Trojan camp? 4s None will accept the task, I fear, to creep Alone at dead of night, a spy, within The hostile lines ; — a bold man must he be." Then answered Agamemnon, king of men : — "Most noble Menelaus, much we need s» Wise counsel — thou and I — to save our men And galleys from destruction, since the will Of Jove is changed. Now hath the God respect To Hector's sacrifices; for in truth I never saw — I never heard of one ss Who in one day performed such mighty deeds As Hector, dear to Jove, just now hath wrought, Though not the son of goddess or of god. Those deeds will be, I deem, for many a day A cause of bitter sorrow to the Greeks, — Such evil hath he wrought. Now go at once, And from their galleys call Idomeneus</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Ajax; while to noble Nestor's tent I go, and pray that he will rise and give Their orders to the sacred band of guards; — »s For they will hearken to him, since his son Commands them jointly with Meriones, The armor-bearer of Idomeneus, — Both named by us to that important trust.'' Then Menelaus, great in battle, said :— 70 "What wilt thou, then, and what dost thou com- mand, — That I remain with them until thou come, Or, having given the message, seek thee here?" Again the monarch Agamemnon spake :— "Wait there, lest as we go I meet thee not, 7s For many ways are through the camp. But thou, In going, shout aloud and bid them all Be vigilant, accosting every one By his paternal name, and giving each Due honor: bear thyself not haughtily: We too must labor; for when we were born Jove laid this hard condition on us all." So spake he, and, dismissing with that charge His brother, hastened to where Nestor lay, The shepherd of his people. Him he found «s On his soft couch within his tent beside His dark-brown ship. Around him scattered shone His arms, — a shield, two spears, a gleaming helm, And pliant belt, with which the ancient man Girded himself when arming to lead on</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His men to murderous fight; — for not to age The warrior yielded yet. He raised his head, And, leaning on his elbow, questioned thus Atrides: "Who art thou that traversest The camp beside the fleet at dead of night, ss Alone, while others sleep? Com'st thou to find One of the guardsmen, or a comrade? Speak; Come not in silence thus: what wouldst thou have?" Then answered Agamemnon, king of men :— "O Nestor, son of Neleus, whom the Greeks wo All glory in! thou certainly wilt know Atrides Agamemnon, whom the will Of Jove hath visited with hardships great Beyond what others bear, to last while breath Is in my lungs, and while my knees can move. 103 I wander thus abroad because sweet sleep Comes not to close my eyelids, and the war And slaughter of the Greeks distress me sore. For them I greatly fear, my heart is faint, My mind confounded. In my breast the heart Pants, and my limbs all tremble. If thou wilt, — For, as I see, thou also dost not sleep, — Come with me to the guards, that we may know Whether, o'ercome by toil and weariness, They give themselves to slumber and forget »s Their watch. The foe is near us in his camp, And how know we that even now by night He plans not, to attack us in our tents?" Then Nestor, the Gerenian knight, replied:—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>"Atrides Agamemnon, glorious king m» Of men, almighty Jove will not perform For Hector all that Hector plans and hopes; And heavier cares, I think, will yet be his When once Achilles' wrath is turned away. Yet willingly I join thee. Let us call ns The other chiefs, —r Ulysses, Diomed, Both mighty spearmen; Ajax, swift of foot; And the brave son of Phyleus. It were well To send and bid the mightier Ajax come, And King Idomeneus, for farthest off 130 The ships of both are stationed. I shall chide Thy brother Menelaus — though he be Honored and dear, and though it please thee not — For sleeping, while he leaves such toils as these To thee alone. He should be here among ib The chiefs, exhorting them to valiant deeds; For now the hour of bitter need is come." Again spake Agamemnon, king of men :— "At other times, old chief, I would have begged That thou shouldst blame him: he is oft remiss, •#, And late to act; but not because of sloth, Or want of spirit, but he looks to me And waits for my example. Yet to-night He rose before me, sought me, and is sent To call the chiefs whom thou hast named ; and now Let us go on, and meet them where they wait, ,4« Among the guards and just before the gates, — For I appointed that the trysting-place."</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Nestor, the Gerenian knight, replied :— "Then let no Greek condemn him, or refuse iso To heed and to obey when he shall speak." He spake, and drew his tunic o'er his breast, Laced the fair sandals to his shapely feet, And round him fastened, with a clasp, his cloak,— A double web of purple, with full folds 'ss And flowing pile. He grasped a massive spear, Its blade of trenchant brass. And first he sought The galleys of the Achaians brazen-mailed. There shouted Nestor the Gerenian knight, To raise Ulysses, best of counsellors, ,,*, Jove-like in wisdom; who perceived the voice, And issued from his tent in haste, and said : — "What brings you forth to walk the camp at night, Beside the ships alone; what urgent cause?" Then answered Nestor, the Gerenian knight: — iss "Son of Laertes, nobly born, and skilled In wise devices, be thou not displeased: A fearful woe impends above the Greeks: Come, then, and call the other chiefs, to give Their counsel whether we shall flee or fight." ,70 He spake ; and wise Ulysses, entering His tent again, upon his shoulders laid His well-wrought shield, and joined them as they went, Till, coming to Tydides Diomed, They found him by his tent among his arms, 17s His comrades sleeping round him with their shielJs</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beneath their heads. Their spears were set upright, The nether points in earth. The polished brass Gleamed like the lightnings of All-Father Jove. In sleep the hero lay; a wild bull's hide Was spread beneath him, and a carpet dyed With glowing colors propped his head. The knight, • Gerenian Nestor, touched him with his foot And roused him, and addressed him chidingly :— "O son of Tydeus! wilt thou calmly sleep All the night long? And hast thou, then, not heard That on a height amidst the plain the sons Of Troy are stationed, near the ships, and small The space that parts the enemy's camp from ours?" He spake. The son of Tydeus sprang from sleep At once, and answered him with winge 1 words :—r- "Thy labors are too constant, aged man; ,v Thou shrinkest from no hardship. Are there not Young men among the Greeks to walk the camp And call the kings? Thou never takest rest." 19s And Nestor, the Gerenian knight, replied :— "Well hast thou said, my friend, for I have sons Without reproach, and I have many troops; And any one of these might walk the camp And give the summons. But to-night there lies *» A hard necessity upon the Greeks, And their destruction and their rescue hang Balanced on a knife's edge. Come then, since thou Art younger, call swift Ajax and the son Of Phyleus, if thou wouldst relieve my age."</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He spake ; and Diomed around him flung A tawny lion's ample hide, that reached Down to his feet, and took his spear and went And summoned the two kings, and brought them forth. Now when they came among the assembled guard, Its leaders were not slumbering; every man «, Sat watchful and in arms. As dogs that guard Flocks in a sheepfold hear some savage beast That comes through thickets down the mountain- side; Loud is the clamor of the dogs and men, «s And sleep is frightened thence, — so gentle sleep Fled from the eyes of those who watched, that night, Sadly, with eyes turned ever toward the plain, Intently listening for the foe's approach. The aged Nestor saw them, and rejoiced, »*, And thus encouraged them with winged words : — "Watch thus, dear youths, let no one yield to sleep, Lest we become the mockery of the foe." He spake, and crossed the trench ; and with him went The Grecian leaders, they who had been called »s To council. With them went Meriones And Nestor's eminent son, for they had both Been summoned. Crossing to the other side Of that deep trench, they found an open space Clear of the dead, in which they sat them down, — Just where the fiery Hector, having slain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Many Achaians, turned him back vvh:n night Came o'er him. There they sat to hold debate And thus spake Nestor the Gerenian knight:— "Friends! is there none among you who so far Trusts his own valor that he will to-night Venture among the Trojans? He perchance Might capture on the borders of the camp Some foeman wandering, or might bring report Of what they meditate, and whether still They mean to keep their station far from Troy And near our ships, or, since their late success, Return to Ilium. Could he safely bring This knowledge back to us, his meed were great, Glory among all men beneath the sky, And liberal recompense. As many chiefs As now command our galleys, each would give A black ewe with a suckling lamb, — such gifts No one hath yet received, — and he should sit A guest at all our banquets and our feasts." He spake ; and all were silent for a space. Then Diomed, the great in battle, said : — "Nestor, my resolute spirit urges me To explore the Trojan camp, that lies so near; Yet, were another warrior by my side, I should go forth with a far surer hope, And greater were my daring. For when two Join in the same adventure, one perceives Before the other how they ought to act; While one alone, however prompt, resolves</span>
					<br/>
					<span>More tardily and with a weaker will." He spake; and many a chief made suit to share The risk with Diomed. The ministers Of Mars, the chieftains Ajax, asked to go; Meriones desired it; Nestor's son *ss Greatly desired to join the enterprise; Atrides Menelaus, skilled to wield The spear, desired it; and that hardy chief, Ulysses, longed to explore the Trojan camp, For full of daring aims was the great soul v0 Within his bosom. Agamemnon then, The king of men, took up the word and said :— "Tydides Diomed, most dear of men, Choose from the many chiefs, who ask to bear A part svith thee, the bravest. Be not moved m By deference to take the worse and leave The abler warrior. Pay no heed to rank, Or race, or wide extent of kingly rule." Thus spake the king; for in his heart he feared For fair-haired Menelaus. Diomed, j«o The great in battle, then addressed them all :— "Ye bid me choose: how, then, can I o'erlook Godlike Ulysses, prudent in resolve, And firm in every danger, well beloved By Pallas. Give me him, and our return »b3 Is sure, though from consuming flames ; for he Is wise to plan beyond all other men." Ulysses, nobly born and hardy, spake In turn: "Tydides, praise me not too much,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor blame me, for thou speakest to the Greeks, »9» Who know me. Meantime let us haste to go, For the night wears away, and morn is near. The stars are high, two thirds of night are past,—• The greater part, —and scarce a third remains." He spake; and both arrayed themselves for fight. The mighty warrior Thrasymedes gave The two-edged sword he wore to Diomed, — Whose own was at the gilleys, — and a shield. The hero then put on his helmet, made Of tough bull-hide, with neither cone nor crest, — Such as is worn by beardless youths. A bow, sm Quiver, and sword Meriones bestowed Upon Ulysses, placing on his brows A leathern helmet, firmly laced within By many a thong, and on the outer side *,s Set thickly with a tusky boar's white teeth, Which fenced it well and skilfully. A web Of woollen for the temples lined the work. This helm Autolycus once bore away From Eleon, the city where he sacked v0 The stately palace of Amyntor, son Of Ormenus. The captor gave the prize To the Cytheran chief, Amphidamas, Who bore it to Scandeia, and in turn Bestowed it upon Molus as his guest, 31s And Molus gave it to Meriones, His son, to wear in battle. Now at last It crowned Ulysses' temples. When the twaiD</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were all accoutred in their dreadful arms, Forward they went, and left the assembled chiefs, While, sent by Pallas forth, upon their right »» A heron flew beside their path. The bird They saw not, for the night was dark, but heard Its rustling wings. Ulysses at the sound Rejoiced, and supplicated Pallas thus :— *s "Hear! daughter of the /Egis-bearer Jove! Thou who art near me in all dangers, thou Whose eye is on me wheresoe'er I go, Befriend me, Pallas, yet again, and grant That, laden with great glory, we return 330 Safe to the galleys, mighty deeds performed, And woe inflicted on the Trojan race." Next Diomed, the great in battle, prayed :— "Daughter invincible of Jove, give ear Also to me. Be with me now, as once 33s Thou didst attend on Tydeus nobly born, My father, when he bore an embassy To Thebe from the Achaians. He beside The Asopus left the Achaians mailed in brass, And bore a friendly message to the sons 3#, Of Cadmus, and on his return performed Full many a mighty deed with aid from thee, Great goddess! for thou stoodest by his side. Stand now by me; be thou my shield and guard; And I, in turn, will offer up to thee 34s A yearling heifer, broad between the horns, Which never ploughman yet hath tamed to bear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The yoke. Her to thine altar will I bring, With gilded horns, to be a sacrifice." So prayed they. Pallas listened to their prayers; And, having supplicated thus the child 3s, Of Jove Almighty, the two chiefs went on Like lions through the darkness of the night, Through slaughter, heaps of corses, and black blood. Nor now had Hector suffered the brave sons 3ss Of Troy to sleep, but summoned all the chiefs, Leaders, and princes of the host, and thus Addressed the assembly with well-ordered words:— "Who of you all will promise to perform The task I set him, for a large reward? 3* For ample shall his meed be. I will give A chariot and two steeds with lofty necks, Swifter than the swift galleys of the Greeks. Great glory will be his whoever dares Approach those ships and bring the knowledge thence *&gt;; Whether the fleet is guarded as before, Or whether, yielding to our arms, the foe Is meditating flight, and, through the night O'ercome with weariness, keeps watch no more." He spake; and all were silent for a space. 37c Now there was one, among the Trojan chiefs, Whose father was Eumedes, of the train Of reverend heralds. Dolon was his name, And he was rich in gold and brass, deformed In face but swift of foot, an only son</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Among five sisters. He stood forth among The Trojans, and replied to Hector thus : — "My daring spirit, Hector, urges me To visit the swift ships and learn the state Of the Greek host. But hold thy sceptre forth, 3'-0 And solemnly attest the gods that thou Wilt give to me the horses, and the car Engrailed with brass, which bear the illustrious son Of Peleus. I shall not explore in vain, Nor balk thy hope of me ; for I will pass 3ss Into the camp until I reach the ship Of Agamemnon, where the chiefs are now Debating whether they shall fly or fight." He spake; and Hector held the sceptre forth, And swore : "Be Jupiter the Thunderer, 390 Husband of Juno, witness, that those steeds Shall bear no other Trojan than thyself. That honor I confirm to thee alone." He spake. It was an idle oath, yet gave New courage to the spy, who instantly 31s Upon his shoulders hung his crooked bow, And round him flung a gray wolf's hide, and placed A casque of otter-skin upon his head, And took his pointed javelin, and made haste To reach the Grecian fleet. Yet was he doomed «0 Never to leave that fleet again, nor bring Tidings to Hector. Soon was he beyond The crowd of men and steeds, and eagerly Held on his way. Ulysses first perceived</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His coming, and thus spake to Diomed : — ** "Some one, Tydides, from the enemy's camp Is coming, either as a spy, or else To spoil the dead. First let us suffer him To pass us by a little on the plain, Then let us rush and seize him. Should his speed Be greater than our own, let us attack The fugitive with spears, and drive him on To where our ships are lying, from his camp, Lest, flying townward, he escape our hands." He spake ; and both lay down without the path. Among the dead, while he unwarily 416 Passed by them. When he now had gone as far As two yoked mules might at the furrow's end Precede a pair of oxen, — for by mules »«• The plough is drawn more quickly through the soil Of the deep fallow, — then they rose, and rushed To seize him. As he heard their steps he stopped. In hope that his companions had been sent From Troy by Hector to conduct him back. But when they came within a javelin's cast, vs Or haply less, he saw that they were foes, And moved his nimble knees, and turned to flee, While rapidly they followed. As two hounds, Sharp-toothed, and trained to track their prey, pursue Through forest-grounds some fawn or hare that runs Before them panting, so did Diomed «$, And terrible Ulysses without stop Follow the fugitive, to cut him off</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From his own people. In his flight he came 434 Where soon he would have mingled with the guards, Close to the fleet. Then Pallas breathed new strength Into Tydides, that no other Greek Might boast that he had wounded Dolon first, And steal the honor. Therefore, with his spear Uplifted, Diomed rushed on and spake :— 4*, "Stop, or my spear o'ertakes thee, nor wilt thou Escape a certain death from this right hand." He spake, and hurled his spear — but not to smite — At Dolon, over whose right shoulder passed The polished weapon, and, descending, pierced 4« The ground. Then Dolon, pale and fear-struck, stopped, And quaked, with chattering teeth and stammeiing speech. They, breathless with the chase, came up and seizcd His hands, while, bursting into tears, he spake : — "Take me alive, and ye shall have from me 4s» A ransom : there is store of brass and gold And well-wrought steel, of which a princely share My father will bestow when he shall hear Of me alive and at the Grecian fleet." The crafty chief Ulysses answered thus : — 4ss "Take heart, and cease to think of death, but tell, And truly, why thou eamest to our fleet: Was it to strip the bodies of the dead? Camest thou, sent by Hector, as a spy</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Among our ships, or of thine own accord?" «* And Dolon answered, trembling still with fear : — "Hector, against my will and to my hurt, Persuaded me. He promised to bestow On me the firm-paced coursers, and the car Engrailed with brass, which bear the illustrious son Of Peleus, and enjoined me by the aid Of darkness to approach the foe and learn Whether ye guard your galleys as before, Or, overcome by us, consult on flight, And, wearied with the hardships of the day, 4i0 Have failed to set the accustomed nightly watch." The man of craft, Ulysses, smiled, and said : — "Truly, thy hope was set on princely gifts, — The steeds of war-renowned ^Eacides, Hard to be reined by mortal hands, or driven as By any, save by Peleus' son himself, Whom an immortal mother bore. But come, Tell me, — and tell the truth, — where hast thou left Hector, the leader of the host, and where Are laid his warlike arms; where stand his steeds; Where are the sentinels, and where the tents * Of other chiefs? On what do they consult? Will they remain beside our galleys here, Or do they meditate, since, as they say, The Greeks are beaten, a return to Troy?" «ss Dolon, Eumedes' son, made answer thus :— "What thou requirest I will truly tell. Hector is with his counsellors, and now,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Apart from all the bustle, at the tomb Of Ilus the divine, he plans the war. 490 Sentries, of whom thou speakest, there are none; No chosen band, O hero! has in charge To guard the camp. By all their blazing fires, Constrained by need, the Trojans keep awake, And each exhorts his fellow to maintain «s The watch: not so the auxiliar troops who came From far: they sleep, and since they have no wives Nor children near, they let the Trojans watch." Then thus the man of wiles, Ulysses, spake :— "How sleep they, — mingled with the knights of Troy y» Or by themselves? Tell me, that I may know." Dolon, Eumedes' son, made answer thus : — "What thou requirest I will truly tell. On one hand, toward the sea, the bowmen lie Of Caria and Paeonia, and with them s0s Lelegans, Caucons, and the gallant tribe Of the Pelasgians. On the other hand, Toward Thymbra, are the Lycians, the proud race Of Mysia, Phrygia's knights, and cavalry Of the Maeonians. Why should ye inquire s10 The place of each? If ye design to-night To penetrate into the Trojan camp, There are the Thracians, newly come, apart From all the others: with them is their king, Rhesus, the son of Eioneus; his steeds . sa Are far the largest and most beautiful</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I ever saw, — the snow is not so white, The wind is not so swift. His chariot shines With gold and silver, and the coat of mail In which he came to Troy is all of gold, s» And gloriously and marvellously bright, Such as becomes not mortal men to wear, But the gods only. Now to your swift Ships Lead me; or bind me fast with thongs, and here Leave me till your return ; and ye shall know s»s Whether the words I speak be true or false." Then sternly spake the gallant Diomed : — "Once in our hands a prisoner, do not think, O Dolon! to escape, though thou hast told Things that shall profit us. For if we now s30 Release thee thou wilt surely come again To the Greek fleet, a spy, or openly To fight against us. If I take thy life, 'T is certain thou wilt harm the Greeks no more." He spake. And as the suppliant took his chin sis In his large hand, and had begun a prayer, He smote him with his sword at the mid-neck, And cut the tendons both; the severed head, While yet he spake, fell, rolling in the dust. And then they took his helm of otter-skin, s« The wolPs-hide, sounding bow, and massive spear. The nobly born Ulysses in his hand Lifted the trophies high, devoting them To Pallas, deity of spoil, and prayed :— "Delight thyself, O goddess, in these arms,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For thee we first invoke, of all the gods Upon Olympus. Guide us now to find The camp and coursers of the sons of Thrace." He spake ; and, raising them aloft, he hung The spoils upon a tamarisk, and brake ?s-, Reeds and the spreading branches of the tree To form a mark, that so on their return They might not, in the darkness, miss the spot. Then onward, mid strewn arms and pools of blood, They went, and soon were where the Thracians lay. There slept the warriors, overpowered with toil; s9s Their glittering arms were near them, fairly ranged In triple rows, and by each suit of arms Two coursers. Rhesus slumbered in the midst. Near him were his fleet horses, which were made Fast to the chariot's border by the reins. s«, Ulysses saw them first, and, pointing, said :— "This is the man, O Diomed, and these The steeds, described by Dolon whom we slew. Come, then ; put forth thy strength of arm, for ill Doth it become thee to stand idle here, «* Armed as thou art. Loose thou the steeds; or else Slay thou the men, and leave the steeds to me." He spake. The blue-eyed Pallas straightway gave Strength to Tydides, who on every side s70 Dealt slaughter. From the smitten by the sword Rose fearful groans; the ground was red with blood. As when a ravening lion suddenly Springs on a helpless flock of goats or sheep,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So fell Tydides on the Thracian band, s7s Till twelve were slain. Whomever Diomed Approached and smote, the sage Ulysses seized, And drew him backward by the feet, that thus The flowing-maned coursers might pass forth Unhindered, nor, by treading on the dead, s*, Be startled; for they yet were new to war. Now when the son of Tydeus reached the king, — The thirteenth of his victims, — him he slew As he breathed heavily; for on that night A fearful dream, in shape CEnides' son, 5»3 Stood o'er him, sent by Pallas. Carefully Ulysses meantime loosed the firm-paced steeds, And, fastening them together, drave them forth, Urging them with his bow: he had not thought To take the showy lash that lay in sight s» On the fair chariot-seat. In going thence He whistled, as a sign to Diomed, Who lingered, pondering on his next exploit, — Whether to seize the chariot where was laid The embroidered armor, dragging it away; ss.s Or, lifting it aloft, to bear it thence; Or take more Thracian lives. As thus his thoughts Were busy, Pallas, standing near him, spake : — "O son of large-souled Tydeus, think betimes Of thy return to where the galleys lie; ,*» Else may some god arouse the sons of Troy, And thou be forced to reach the ships by flight." She spake. He knew the goddess by her voice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And leaped upon a steed. Ulysses lashed The horses with his bow, and on they flew «0s Toward the swift galleys of the Grecian host. Apollo, bearer of the silver bow, Kept no vain watch, and, angry when he saw Minerva at the side of Diomed, Down to 'he mighty host of Troy he came, «to And roused from sleep a Thracian counsellor, — Hippocoon, a kinsman of the house Of Rhesus. Leaping from his couch, he saw The vacant spot where the swift steeds had stood, And, weltering in their blood, the dying chiefs, He saw, and wept aloud, and called by name His dear companion. Then a clamor rose, And boundless tumult, as the Trojans came All rushing to the spot, and marvelling At what the daring warriors, who were now «» Returning to the hollow ships, had done. And when these warriors now had reached the spot Where Hector's spy was slain, Ulysses, dear To Jupiter, reined in the fiery steeds, And Diomed leaped down and took the spoil Blood-stained, and gave it to Ulysses' hands, And mounted. Then again they urged the steeds, Which, not unwilling, flew along the way. First Nestor heard the approaching sound, and said : — "Friends, chiefs and princes of the Greeks, my heart—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Truly or falsely — urges me to speak. The trampling of swift steeds is in my ears. 0 that Ulysses and the gallant son Of Tydeus might be bringing at this hour Firm-footed coursers from the enemy's camp! «3$ Yet must I fear that these, our bravest chiefs, Have met disaster from the Trojan crew." While he was speaking yet, the warriors came. They sprang to earth; their friends, rejoicing, flocked Around them, greeting them with grasp of hands «*, And with glad words, while the Gerenian knight, Nestor, inquired: "Declare, illustrious chief, Glory of Greece, Ulysses, how ye took These horses: from the foe ; — or did some god Bestow them? They are glorious as the sun. m Oft am I midst the Trojans, for, though old, 1 lag not idly at the ships; yet ne'er Have my eyes looked on coursers like to these. Some god, no doubt, has given them, for to Jove, The God of storms, and Pallas, blue-eyed child «so Of aegis-bearing Jove, ye both are dear." Then sage Ulysses answered: "Pride of Greece! Neleian Nestor, truly might a god Have given us nobler steeds than even these. All power is with the gods. But these of which 5ss Thou askest, aged man, are brought from Thrace, And newly come. Brave Diomed hath slain Their lord, and twelve companions by his side, — All princes. Yet another victim fell,—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A spy whom, near our ships, we put to death, — A man whom Hector and his brother chiefs Sent forth by midnight to explore our camp." He spake, and gayly caused the firm-paced steeds To pass the trench ; the other Greeks, well pleased, Went with him.

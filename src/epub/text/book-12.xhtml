					<span>Thus in the camp Menoetius' valiant son Tended Eurypylus, and dressed his wounds; While yet in mingled throngs the warriors fought, —- Trojans and Greeks. Nor longer was the trench A barrier for the Greeks, nor the broad wall Which they had built above it to defend Their fleet; for all around it they had drawn The trench, yet not with chosen hecatombs Paid to the gods, that so it might protect</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The galleys and the heaps of spoil they held. » Without the favor of the gods it rose, And therefore was not long to stand entire. As long as Hector lived, and Peleus' son Was angered, and King Priam's city yet Was not o'erthrown, so long the massive wall is Built by the Greeks stood firm. But when at length The bravest of the Trojans had been slain, And many of the Greeks were dead, — though still Others survived, — and when in the tenth year The city of Priam fell, and in their ships ™ The Greeks went back to their beloved land, Then did Apollo and the god of sea Consult together to destroy the wall By turning on it the resistless might Of rivers, all that from the Idaean heights n Flow to the ocean, — Rhesus, Granicus, Heptaporus, Caresus, Rhodius, ^isepus, and Scamander's hallowed stream, And Simois, in whose bed lay many shields And helms and bodies of slain demigods. *, Phoebus Apollo turned the mouths of these All toward one spot; nine days against the wall He bade their currents rush, while Jupiter Poured constant rain, that floods might overwhelm The rampart; and the god who shakes the earth, as Wielding his trident, led the rivers on. He flung among the billows the huge beams And stones which, with hard toil, the Greeks had laid</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For the foundations. Thus he levelled all Beside the hurrying Hellespont, destroyed « The bulwarks utterly, and overspread The long broad shore with sand; and then he brought Agam the rivers to the ancient beds In which their gently flowing waters ran. This yet was to be done in time to come « By Neptune and Apollo. Meanwhile raged Battle and tumult round that strong-built wall.' The towers in all their timbers rang with blows; And, driven as by the scourge of Jove, the Greeks, Hemmed closely in beside their roomy ships, s, Trembled at Hector, the great scatterer Of squadrons, fighting, as he did before, With all a whirlwind's might. As when a boar Or lion mid the hounds and huntsmen stands, Fearfully strong, and fierce of eye, and they ss In square array assault him, and their hands Fling many a javelin ; — yet his noble heart Fears not, nor does he fly, although at last His courage cause his death ; and oft he turns. And tries their ranks; and where he makes a rush The ranks give way ; — so Hector moved and turned Among the crowd, and bade his followers cross The trench. The swift-paced horses ventured not The leap, but stood upon the edge and neighed Aloud, for the wide space affrighted them;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hard it was to spring across, or pass From side to side, for on each side the brink Was steep, and bristled with sharp stakes, close set And strong, which there the warrior sons of Greece Had planted, a defence against the foe. 70 No steed that whirled the rapid car along Could enter, but the soldiery on foot Eagerly sought to pass, and in these words Polydamas to daring Hector spake : — "Hector, and ye who lead the troops of Troy n And our auxiliars! rashly do we seek To urge our rapid steeds across the trench So hard to pass, beset with pointed stakes, — And the Greek wall so near. The troops of horse Cannot descend nor combat there: the space «0 Is narrow: they would all be slain. If Jove, The Thunderer of the skies, design to crush The Greeks and succor Troy, I should rejoice Were the design at once fulfilled, and all The sons of Greece ingloriously cut off, bs Far from their Argos. But if they should turn Upon us, and repulse us from their fleet, And we become entangled in the trench, I deem no messenger would e'er go back To Troy from fighting with the rallied Greeks. «• Heed, then, my words, and let the charioteers Stay with the coursers at the trench, while we, Armed, and on foot, and all in close array, Follow our Hector. For the Greeks in vain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Will strive to stem our onset if, in truth, The hour of their destruction be at hand." So spake Polydamas; and Hector, pleased To hear the prudent counsel, leaped to earth With all his arms, and left his car. The rest Rode with their steeds no more, but, hastily » Dismounting, as they saw their noble chief, Each bade his charioteer hold back his steeds, Reined at the trench, in ranks. And then, apart, They mustered in five columns, following close Their leaders. First, the largest, bravest band, « Those who, with resolute daring, longed to break The rampart and to storm the fleet, were led By Hector and the good Polydamas, Joined with Cebriones, — for Hector left His chariot to the care of one who held n An humbler station than Cebriones. Paris, Alcathoiis, and Agenor led A second squadron. Helenus, a son Of Priam, and Deiphobus, a youth Of godlike form, his brother, took command « Of yet a third, — with whom in rank was joined The hero Asius, son of Hyrtacus, Whose bright-haired coursers, of majestic size, Had borne him from Arisba and the banks Of Selleis. /Eneas led the fourth, — « The brave son of Anchises; and with him Were joined Archilochus and Acamas, Sons of Antenor, skilled in arts of war.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The band of Troy's illustrious allies followed Sarpedon, who from all the rest »s Had chosen, to partake in the command, Glaucus and brave Asteropteus. These He deemed the bravest under him ; yet he Stood foremost of them all in warlike might. Then all, with their stout bucklers of bull's-hide Adjusted to each other, bravely marched 131 Against the Greeks, who, as they deemed, must fly- Before them, and must fall by their black ships. Then all the other Trojans, and the allies From foreign shores, obeyed the counsel given m By good Polydamas ; but Asius, son Of Hyrtacus, and prince of men, chose not To leave his chariot and his charioteer, But drave with them against the roomy ships. Vain youth ! — he was not destined to return, mo Borne by his steeds and chariot, from the fleet, And from the fate he braved, to wind-swept Troy. His evil fate o'ertook him from the spear Of great Idomeneus, Deucalion's son; For toward the galleys moored upon the left us He hastened by the way in which the Greeks, With steeds and cars, retreated from the plain. Thither he drave his coursers ; there he found The gates not closed, nor the long bar across, But warriors held them open to receive 1s» In safety their companions as they fled From battle to the fleet. Exultingly</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He turned his coursers thither, and his men Followed him, shouting; for they thought the Greeks Could not abide their onset, but must yield, .ss And perish by their ships. Deluded men ! — They met two mighty warriors at the gate, — The brave descendants of the Lapithae, That warlike tribe: Pirithoiis' gallant son Was one, named Polypoetes; with him stood •* Leonteus, strong as Mars the slayer of men. By the tall gates they stood, as giant oaks Stand on the mountains and abide the wind And the tempestuous rains of all the year, Firm-planted on their strong and spreading roots. So they, confiding in their strength of arm, Waited for mighty Asius hasting on, And fled not. Onward came the hostile troop, With their.tough shields uplifted, and with shouts: All rushing toward the massive wall they came, ,t» Following King Asius, and Iamenus, Orestes, Thoon, Acamas the son Of Asius, and CEnomaus. Meanwhile Leonteus and his comrade had retired Within, encouraging the well-armed Greeks ,7s To combat for the fleet; but when they saw The rout and panic of their flying host, They darted forth and fought before the gates, — Fought like wild boars that in the mountains meet A clamorous troop of men and dogs, and dart ,, Sideway at their assailants, break the trees</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Close to the root, and fiercely gnash their tusks, Until some javelin strikes them, and they die. So on the breasts of the two warriors rang The shining brass, oft smitten ; for they fought '«% Fearlessly, trusting in the aid of those Who held the wall, and their own valiant arms. And they who stood on the strong towershurled down Stones, to defend the Achaians and their tents And theii swift ships. As snow-flakes fall to earth 90 When strong winds, driving on the shadowy cloud, Shower them upon the nourishing glebe, so thick Were showered the weapons from the hands of Greeks And Trojans; and the helms and bossy shields, Beaten by stones, resounded. Asius then — m The son of Hyrtacus — in anger groaned, And smote his thighs impatiently, and said :— O Father Jove! thou then art wholly false. I did not look to see the men of Greece Stand thus before our might and our strong arms ; «0 Yet they, like pliant-bodied wasps or bees, That build their cells beside the rocky way, And quit not their abode, but, waiting there The hunter, combat for their young — so these, Although but two, withdraw not from the gates, ~s Nor will, till they be slain ot seized alive." He spake; but moved not thus the will of Jove, Who planned to give the glory of the day To Hector. Meanwhile, at the other gates</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fought other warriors, — but't were hard for me,»,0 Were I a god, to tell of all their deeds; For round the wall on every side there raged, Fierce as consuming fire, a storm of stones. The Greeks, in bitter anguish, yet constrained, Fought for their fleet; and sorrowful were all »'s The gods who in the battle favored Greece. Now the two Lapithae began the fight. Pirithous' son, brave Polypoetes, cast His spear at Damasus; it broke its way Through the helm's brazen cheek, — nor that alone: Right through the temple went the brazen blade, », And crushed the brain within. He left him slain, And next struck Pylon down, and Ormenus. Leonteus, of the stock of Mars, assailed Hippomachus, who from Antimachus »s Derived his birth; he pierced him at the belt, And, drawing forth his trenchant sword, hewed down, In combat hand-to-hand, Antiphates; He dashed him backward to the ground, and next Smote Menon and Iamenus ; and last v- He slew Orestes: at his feet they lay, A pile of dead, upon their mother Earth. Then, as the twain were stripping from the dead Their glittering arms, the largest, bravest band Of those who eagerly desired to break »33 The rampart and to burn the ships with fire, Following Polydamas and Hector, stood Consulting at the trench. An augury,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Just as they were in act to cross, appeared Upon the left: an eagle high in air, Between the armies, in his talons bore A monstrous serpent, bleeding, yet alive And palpitating, — nor disabled yet For combat; for it turned, and on the breast Wounded the eagle, near the neck. The bird In pain let fall his prize amid the host, And flew away, with screams, upon the wind. The Trojans shuddered at the spotted snake Lying among them, and Polydamas Said thus to fearless Hector, standing near: — "Hector, thou almost ever chidest me In council, even when I judge aright. I know it ill becomes the citizen To speak against the way that pleases thee, In war or council, — he should rather seek To strengthen thy authority; yet now I will declare what seems to me the best: Let us not combat with the Greeks, to take Their fleet; for this, I think, will be the end, If now the omen we have seen be meant For us of Troy who seek to cross the trench; This eagle, flying high upon the left, Between the hosts, that in his talons bore A monstrous serpent, bleeding, yet alive, Hath dropped it mid our host before he came To his dear nest, nor brought it to his brood; So we, although by force we break the gates</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And rampart, and although the Greeks fall back, Shall not as happily retrace our way; For many a Trojan shall we leave behind, »7o Slain by the weapons of the Greeks, who stand And fight to save their fleet. Thus will the seer, Skilled in the lore of prodigies, explain The portent, and the people will obey." Sternly the crested Hector looked, and spake:— "Polydamas, the thing that thou hast said Pleases me not, and easily couldst thou Frame better counsels. If thy words convey Thy earnest thought, the gods assuredly Have made thee lose thy senses. Thou dost ask That I no longer reverence the decree * Of Jove, the Thunderer of the sky, who gave His promise, and confirmed it. Thou dost ask That I be governed by the flight of birds, Which I regard not, whether to the right And toward the morning and the sun they fly, Or toward the left and evening. We should heed The will of mighty Jupiter, who bears Rule over gods and men. One augury There is, the surest and the best, — to fight For our own land. Why dreadest thou the war And conflict? Though we all should fall beside The galleys of the Greeks, there is no fear That thou wilt perish, for thou hast no heart To stand against the foe ;— no warrior thou! Yet, if thou dare to stand aloof, or seek</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By words to turn another from the fight, The spear I wield shall take thy life at once." He spake, and went before; and all his band Followed with fearful clamor. Jupiter, *» The God of thunders, sending a strong wind From the Idaean summits, drave the dust Full on the galleys, and made faint the hearts Of the Greek warriors, and gave new renown To Hector and the men of Troy. For these, m Trusting in portents sent from Jupiter, And their own valor, labored to break through The massive rampart of the Greeks: they tore The galleries from the towers, and levelled down The breastworks, heaved with levers from their place 3™ The jutting buttresses which Argive hands Had firmly planted to support the towers, And brought them to the ground ; and thus they hoped To force a passage to the Grecian camp. Not yet did they of Greece give way : they fenced 31s The rampart with their ox-hide shields, and smote The enemy from behind them as he came Under the wall. The chieftains Ajax flew From tower to tower, and cheered the Achaians on, And roused their valor, — some with gentle words, And some with harsh rebuke, — whome'er they saw Skulk from the toils and dangers of the fight. v* "O friends !" they said, " ye great in war, and ye</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of less renown, and ye of little note! — For all are not alike in war, — the time « Demands the aid of all, as well ye know: And now let no man turn him toward the fleet Before the threats of Hector, but press on, And each exhort his fellow : so may Jove, Who flings the lightning from Olympus, grant ss» That, driving back their onset, we may chase The enemy to the very walls of Troy." Thus in the van they shouted, and awoke New courage in the Greeks. As when the flakes Of snow fall thick upon a winter-day, us When Jove the Sovereign pours them down on men, Like arrows, from above ;— he bids the wind Breathe not ; continually he pours them down, And covers every mountain-top and peak, And flowery mead, and field of fertile tilth, w And sheds them on the havens and the shores Of the gray deep; but there the waters bound The covering of snows, — all else is white Beneath that fast-descending shower of Jove ; — So thick the shower of stones from either side «s Flew toward the other^— from the Greeks against The Trojans, and from them against the Greeks; And fearful was the din along the wall. Yet would illustrious Hector and the men Of Troy have failed to force the gates and burst The bar within, had not all-seeing Jove Impelled his son Sarpedon to attack</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Greeks as falls a lion on a herd Of horned beeves. The warrior held his shield, A brazen orb, before him, —beautiful, 3ss And fenced with metal ; for the armorer laid Broad plates without, while under these he sewed Bull's-hides the toughest, edged with golden wires Upon the rim. With this the warrior came, Wielding two spears. As when a lion, bred Among the mountains, fasting long from flesh, Comes into the fenced pastures, without fear, To prey upon the flock; and though he meet The shepherds keeping watch with dogs and spears, Yet will he not be driven thence until 3«s He makes a spring into the fold and bears A sheep away, or in the act is slain, Struck by a javelin from some ready hand ;— Sarpedon, godlike warrior, thus was moved By his great heart to storm the wall and break 370 Through the strong barrier; and to Glaucus, son Of Lycia's king Hippolochus, he said : — "Why, Glaucus, are we honored, on the shores Of Lycia, with the highest seat at feasts, And with full cups? Why look men up to us 37s As to the gods? And why do we possess Broad, beautiful enclosures, full of vines And wheat, beside the Xanthus? Then it well Becomes us, foremost in the Lycian ranks To stand against the foe, where'er the fight 3* Is hottest; so our well-armed Lycian men</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shall say, and truly: 'Not ingloriously Our kings bear rule in Lycia, where they feast On fatlings of the flock, and drink choice wine; For they excel in valor, and they fight #s Among our foremost.' O my friend, if we, Leaving this war, could flee from age and death, I should not here be fighting in the van, Nor would I send thee to the glorious war But now, since many are the modes of death «0 Impending o'er us, which no man can hope To shun, let us press on and give renown To other men, or win it for ourselves!" He spake; and Glaucus not unwillingly Heard and obeyed. Right on the warriors pressed, Leading the Lycian host. Menestheus, son 39« Of Peteus, saw, and trembled ; for they came With evil menace toward his tower. He looke, Along the Grecian lines in hope to see Some chieftain there whose ready help might save *» His comrades from their danger. He beheld The rulers Ajax, never tired of war, Standing with Teucer, who just then had left His tent; and yet they could not hear his shout, So fearful was the din that rose to heaven «s From all the shields, and crested helms, and gates, Smitten with missiles, — for at all the gates The Lycians thundered, struggling hard to break A passage through them. Then Menestheus called A herald near, and bade Thootes bear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A message to the leaders Ajax, thus : — "Go, nobly born Thootes, and in haste Call Ajax, —call them both, for that were best,— Since terrible will be the slaughter here, So fiercely are the Lycians pressing on, 41s Impetuous ever in assault. If there The fight be also urgent, then at least Let the brave Telamonian Ajax come, And Teucer, the great archer, follow him. He spake. The herald listened and obeyed, 4*, And flew along the summit of the wall Built by the Greeks. He reached, and stood beside, The chieftains Ajax, and addressed them thus : — "Ajaces, leaders of the warlike Greeks, The honored son of noble Peteus asks That ye will come, though for a little space, To aid him and to share his warlike toils; For terrible will be the slaughter there, So fiercely are the Lycians pressing on, Impetuous ever in assault. If here 430 The fight be also urgent, then at least Let the brave Telamonian Ajax come. And Teucer, the great archer, follow him." He ended. Ajax, son of Telamon, Hearkened, and to his fellow-warrior said :— 43s "Here, where the gallant Lycomedes stands, Ajax! remain, and, cheering on the Greeks, Lead them to combat valiantly. I go To stem the battle there, and when our friends</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Are succored I will instantly return." «0 So speaking, Ajax, son of Telamon, Departed thence, and with him Teucer, sprung From the same father. With them also went Pandion, carrying Teucer's crooked bow. They came to brave Menestheus at his tower, ui And went within the wall and met their friends, Hard-pressed, — for gallantly the Lycian chiefs And captains, like a gloomy tempest, rushed Up the tall breastworks ; while the Greeks withstood Their onset, and a mighty clamor rose. «0 Then Telamonian Ajax smote to death Epicles, great of soul, Sarpedon's friend: Against that chief he cast a huge, rough stone, That lay high up beside a pinnacle Within the wall. No man with both his hands, — 43s Such men as now are, — though in prime of youth, Could lift its weight; and yet he wielded it Aloft, and flung it. Through the four-coned helm It crashed, and brake the skull within. Down plunged The Lycian, like a diver, from his place 4, On the high tower, and life forsook his limbs. Then Teucer also wounded with a shaft Glaucus, the brave son of Hippolochus, As he leaped forth to scale the lofty wall, — Wounded him where the naked arm was seen, «ss And made him leave the combat. Back he sprang, Hiding amid the crowd, that so the Greeks Might not behold the wounded limb, and scoff.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With grief Sarpedon saw his friend withdraw, Yet paused not from the conflict, but took aim 4™ At Thestor's son, Alcmaon, with his spear; Pierced him ; and drew the weapon out. The Greek, Following the spear, fell headlong; and his arms, Studded with brass, clashed round him as he fell. Then did Sarpedon seize, with powerful hands, 47s The battlement; he wrenched it, and it came To earth, and laid the rampart's summit bare, To make a passage for the assailing host. Ajax and Teucer saw, and both took aim Together at Sarpedon: Teucer's shaft 4so Struck in the midst the buckler's glittering belt, Just at the bosom ; but Jove warded off The death-stroke from his son, lest he should fall Beside the galleys. Ajax, springing, struck The buckler with his spear, and pierced its folds, 4«s And checked the eager warrior, who gave way A little, yet retreated not, but turned, Encouraging the godlike Lycians thus : — "Where, Lycians, is your fiery valor now? Were I the bravest, it were hard, alone, *, For me to force a passage to the fleet, Though I have cleared the way. Come on with me! Light is the task when many share the toil.'' He spake; and they who reverenced his words Of exhortation drew more closely round 4« Their counsellor and sovereign, while the Greeks Above them made their phalanxes more strong</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Within the wall, —for urgent was the need; Since neither could the gallant Syrians break The barrier of the Greeks, and cut their way sm Through to the fleet, nor could the warlike Greeks Drive back the Lycians when they once had reached The rampart. As two men upon a field, With measuring-rods in hand, disputing stand Over the common boundary, in small space, » Each one contending for the right he claims, So, kept asunder by the breastwork, fought The warriors over it, and fiercely struck The orbed bull's-hide shields held up before The breast, and the light targets. Many a one sn Was smitten when he turned and showed the back Unarmed, and many wounded through the shield. The towers and battlements were steeped in blood Of heroes, —Greeks and Trojans. Yet were not The Greeks thus put to flight; but, as the scales si? Are held by some just woman, who maintains, By spinning wool, her household, — carefully She poises both the wool and weights, to make The balance even, that she may provide A pittance for her babes, —thus equally s,» Were matched the warring hosts, till Jupiter Conferred the eminent glory of the day On Hector, son of Priam. He it was Who first leaped down into the space within The Grecian wall, and, with far-reaching voice, Thus shouted, calling to the men of Troy:—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>"Rush on, ye knights of Troy! rush boldly on, And break your passage through the Grecian wall, And hurl consuming flames against their fleet!" So spake he, cheering on his men. They heard, And rushed in mighty throngs against the wall, 33. And climbed the battlements, to charge the foe With spears. Then Hector stooped, and seized a stone Which lay before the gate, broad at the base sm And sharp above, which two, the strongest men, — As men are now, — could hardly heave from earth Into a wain. With ease he lifted it, Alone, and brandished it: such strength the son Of Saturn gave him, that it seemed but light. As when a shepherd carries home with ease s*, A wether's fleece, — he bears it in one hand, And little is he cumbered with its weight, — So Hector bore the lifted stone, to break The beams that strengthened the tall folding-gates. Two bars within, laid crosswise, hcld them firm, — s« Both fastened with one bolt. He came and stood Before them; with wide-parted feet he stood, And put forth all his strength, that so his arm Might drive the missile home ; and in the midst He smote the folding-gates. The blow tore off ss» The hinges ; heavily the great stone fell Within: the portals crashed; nor did the bars Withstand the blow : the shattered beams gave way Before it; and illustrious Hector sprang</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into the camp. His look was stern as night; sss And terribly the brazen armor gleamed That swathed him. With two spears in hand he came, And none except the gods — when once his foot Was on the ground — could stand before his might . His eyes shot fire, and, turning to his men, s«o He bade them mount the wall; and they obeyed: Some o'er the wall, some through the sculptured gate, Poured in. The Achaians to their roomy ships Fled, and a fearful uproar filled the air.</span>

					<span>AS thus they fought with all the rage of fire, Antilochus, the nimble-footed, came With tidings to Achilles. Him he found Before his lofty galleys, deep in thought Of what he knew had happened. With a sigh s The hero to his mighty spirit said :— "Ah me! why should the Grecians thus be driven In utter disarray across the plain? I tremble lest the gods should bring to pass What most I dread. My mother told me once 10 That the most valiant of the Myrmidons, While yet I live, cut off by Trojan hands, Shall see the sun no more. It must be so: The brave son of Menoetius has been slain. Unhappy! T was my bidding that, when once is The enemy with his firebrands was repulsed, He should not think to combat gallantly With Hector, but should hasten to the fleet."</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As thus he mused, illustrious Nestor's son Drew near Achilles, and with eyes that shed » Warm tears he gave his sorrowful message thus :—; "Son of the warlike Peleus, woe is me! For bitter are the tidings thou must hear Of what should not have been. Patroclus lies A naked corpse, and over it the hosts »s Are fighting; crested Hector hath his arms." He spake, and a black cloud of sorrow came Over the chieftain. Grasping in both hands The ashes of the hearth, he showered them o'er His head, and soiled with them his noble face. *, They clung in dark lumps to his comely vest. Prone in the dust of earth, at his full length, And tearing his disordered hair, he lay. Then wailed aloud the maidens whom in war He and Patroclus captured. Forth they came, rs And, thronging round him, smote their breasts and swooned. Antilochus mourned also, and shed tears, Holding Achilles by the hand, for much His generous nature dreaded that the chief Might aim at his own throat the sword he wore. *, Loud were the hero's cries, and in the deep His gracious mother, where she sat beside Her aged father, heard them. She too raised A wail of sorrow. All the goddesses, Daughters of Nereus, dwelling in the depths 4s Of ocean, gathered to her side. There came</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Glauce, Thaleia, and Cymodoce, Nesaea, Speio, Halia with large eyes, And Thoa, and Cymothoe; nor stayed Actaea, Limnoreia, Melita, s0 Amphithoe, Ia±ra, Agave, Dolo, and Proto, and Dynamene. There came Dexamene, Amphinome, Pherusa, Callianira, Panope, Doris, and Galateia, the renowned. ss With these Nemertes and Apseudes came, And Callianassa. Clymene was there, Janeira and Janassa, and with them Maera, and Amatheia with bright hair, And Orithya, and whoever else, «0 Children of Nereus, bide within the deep. The concourse filled the glimmering cave; they beat Their bosoms, while the sorrowing Thetis spake :— "Hear, sister Nereids, that ye all may know The sharpness of my sorrows. Woe is me, «s Unhappy! Woe is me! in evil hour, The mother of a hero, — me who gave Birth to so noble and so brave a son, The first among the warriors, saw him grow Like a green sapling, reared him like a plant v Within a fruitful field, and sent him forth With his beaked ships to Ilium and the war Against the Trojans. Never shall I see That son returning to his home, the halls Of Peleus. While he lives and sees-the light</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of day his lot is sorrow, nor can I Help him in aught, though at his side; and yet I go to look on my beloved son, And learn from him what grief, while he remains Aloof from war, o'ertakes him in his tent." «0 She spake, and left the cavern. All the nymphs Went with her weeping. Round their way the waves Of ocean parted. When they reached the fields Of fertile Troas, up the shore they went In ordered files to where, a numerous fleet, »s Drawn from the water, round Achilles lay The swift ships of the Myrmidons. To him His goddess mother came, and with a cry Of grief embraced the head of her dear son, And, mourning o'er him, spake these winded words :— 90 "Why weepest thou, my son? What sorrow now O'ercomes thy spirit? Speak, and hide it not. All thou didst pray for once, with lifted hands, Has been fulfilled by Jove; the sons of Greece, Driven to their galleys, and with thy good help w Withdrawn from them, are routed and disgraced." The swift Achilles, sighing deeply, made This answer: "O my mother! true it is Olympian Jove hath done all this for me; But how can that delight me, since my friend, 100 My well-beloved Patroclus, is no more? He whom, of all my fellows in the war, I prized the most, and loved as my own self,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is lost to me, and Hector, by whose hand He was cut off, has spoiled him of his arms, — i0s His dreaded arms, a wonder to the sight And glorious, which the gods of heaven bestowed On Peleus, sumptuous bridal gifts, when thou Wert led by them to share a mortal's bed. Yet would that thou hadst evermore remained «0 Among the immortal dwellers of the deep, And Peleus had espoused a mortal maid, Since now thy heart must ache with infinite grief For thy slain son, whom thou shalt never more Welcome returning to his home. No wish m Have I to live or to concern myself In men's affairs, save this: that Hector first, Pierced by my spear, shall yield his life, and pay The debt of vengeance for Patroclus slain." And Thetis, weeping, answered: "O my son! ,«, Soon must thou die; thou sayest true; that fate Hangs over thee as soon as Hector dies." Again the swift Achilles, sighing, spake: "Then quickly let me die, since fate denied That I should aid my friend against the foes ns That slew him. Far from his own land he fell, And longed for me to rescue him. And now, Since I am never more to see the land I love, and since I went not to defend Patroclus, nor the other Greeks, my friends, no Of whom so many have fallen by the hand Of noble Hector, but beside the fleet</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Am sitting here, a useless weight on earth, Mighty in battle as I am beyond The other Grecian warriors, though excelled ys By other men in council, — would that Strife Might perish among gods and men, with Wrath, Which makes even wise men cruel, and, though sweet At first as dropping honey, growing, fills The heart with its foul smoke. Such was my rage, Aroused by Agamemnon, king of men. . ,4 1 Yet now, though great my wrong, let things like these Rest with the past, and, as the time requires, Let us subdue the spirit in our breasts. I go in quest of Hector, by whose hand us My friend was slain. My death will I accept Whene'er to Jove and to the other gods It shall seem good to send it. Hercules, Though mighty and beloved of Jupiter, The son of Saturn, could not shun his death, 130 For fate and Juno's cruel wrath prevailed Against him. I shall lie in death like him, If a like fate be measured out for me. Yet now shall I have glory; I shall do What many a Trojan and Dardanian dame, us Deep-bosomed, wiping with both hands the tears From their fair cheeks, shall bitterly lament; And well shall they perceive that, till this hour, I paused from war. Thou lov'st me; but seek not To keep me from the field, for that were vain."</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The silver-footed Thetis thus rejoined: "Truly, my son, thy purpose is not ill, To rescue thy endangered friends from death. But with the Trojans are thy beautiful arms, Brazen and dazzling bright; their crested chief, i«s Hector, exults to wear them: no long space, I think, will he exult; his death is near. Yet go not to the battle-field until Thine eyes shall look upon me yet again. I come to-morrow with the sun, and bring 170 Bright arms, the work of Vulcan's royal hand." So having said, and turning from her son, She thus bespake her sisters of the sea: "Return to the broad bosom of the deep, To its gray Ancient and my father's halls, ,« And tell him all. I hasten to ascend The summits of Olympus, there to ask Of Vulcan, the renowned artificer, Armor of glorious beauty for my son." She spake: at once they plunged into the deep, ,» While Thetis, silver-footed goddess, sought Olympus, whence it was her hope to bring New armor for her son. As thus her feet Bore her toward heaven, the Achaians, fleeing fast, With infini.e clamor, driven before the arm •ss Of the man-queller Hector, reached the ships And Hellespont. Nor could the well-armed Greeks Bear off Patroclus from the shower of darts; For rushing on them came both foot and horse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Hector, son of Priam, like a flame ,*, In fury. Thrice illustrious Hector seized The body by the heels to drag it off, And called his Trojans with a mighty shout. Thrice did the chieftains Ajax, terrible In resolute valor, drive him from the dead. ms Yet kept he to his purpose, confident In his own might, now charging through the crowd, Now standing firm and shouting to his men, And never losing ground. As when, at night, Herdsmen that watch their cattle strive in vain *» To drive a lion, fierce and famine-pinched, From some slain beast, so the two Ajaxes, With all their valor, vainly strove to keep Hector, the son of Priam, from the corpse. And now would he have dragged it thence, and won Infinite glory, had not Iris come— »s The goddess whose swift feet are like the wind — To Peleus' son, a messenger from heaven, In haste, unknown to Jupiter and all The other gods, — for Juno sent her down, — »,,&gt; To bid the hero arm. She came and stood Beside him, speaking thus with winged words :— "Pelides, rise, most terrible of men, In rescue of Patroclus, over whom They struggle fiercely at the fleet; for there «s They slay each other, — these who fight to keep The dead, and those, the men of Troy, who charge To drag him off to Ilium's airy heights;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And chief, illustrious Hector longs to seize The corpse, and from the delicate neck to hew «*, The head, and fix it on a stake. Arise, Loiter no longer; — rise, ashamed to leave Patroclus to be torn by Trojan dogs. For thine will be the infamy, if yet The corpse be brought dishonored to thy tent." «s The swift Achilles listened and inquired: "Which of the gods, O Iris, speaks by thee?" And Iris, whose swift feet are like the wind, Answered: "The glorious spouse of Jupiter, Juno, hath sent me. Even Saturn's son, »r, On his high throne, knows not that I am sent, Nor any other of the gods who dwell Upon Olympus overspread with snow." "But how," the swift Achilles asked again, •' Shall I go forth to war? They have my arms, »ss And my beloved mother strictly bade That I should put no armor on until I saw her face again. She promised me A suit of glorious mail from Vulcan's hand. Nor know I any warrior here whose arms w Might serve me, save, perhaps, it were the shield Of Telamonian Ajax, who, I hope, Is in the van, and dealing death among The foe, in vengeance for Patroclus slain." Then the swift-footed Iris spake again: ti "They have thy glorious armor; that we know But go thou to the trench, and show thyself</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To them of Troy, that, haply smit with fear, They may desist from battle, and the host Of Grecian warriors, overtoiled, may breathe *s, In a brief respite from the stress of war." So the fleet Iris spake, and passed away, And then arose Achilles, dear to Jove, While o'er his ample shoulders Pallas held Her fringed a?gis. The great goddess caused «a A golden cloud to gather round his head And kindled in the cloud a dazzling flame. And as when smoke, ascending to the sky, Hangs o'er some city in a distant isle, Which enemies beleaguer, swarming forth •*, From their own city, and in hateful strife Contend all day, but when the sun goes down Forthwith blaze many bale-fires, sending up A brightness which the neighboring realms may see, That haply they may send their ships and drive *ss The war away, — so from the hero's head That flame streamed upward to the sky. He came Without the wall and stood beside the trench, Nor mingled with the Greeks, for he revered His mother's words. He stood and called aloud, 170 And Pallas, from the host, returned his shout, — A shout that carried infmite dismay Into the Trojan squadrons. As the sound Of trumpet rises clear when deadly foes Lay siege to a walled city, such was heard m% The clear shout uttered by ^Eacides.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The hearts of all who heard that brazen voice Were troubled, and their steeds with flowing manes Turned backward with the chariots, — such the dread Of coming slaughter. When the charioteers *0 Beheld the terrible flame that played unquenched Upon the brow of the magnanimous son Of Peleus, lighted by the blue-eyed maid Minerva, they were struck with panic fear. Thrice o'er the trench Achilles shouted; thrice *s The men of Troy and their renowned allies Fell into wild disorder. Then there died, Entangled midst their chariots, and transfixed By their own spears, twelve of their bravest chiefs. The Greeks bore off Patroclus from the field »» With eager haste, and placed him on a bier, And there the friends that loved him gathered round Lamenting. With them swift Achilles came, The hot tears on his cheeks, as he beheld His faithful comrade lying on his bier, »9s Mangled with many wounds, whom he had sent With steeds and car to battle, never more To welcome him alive on his return. Now Juno, large-eyed and august, bade set The never-wearied sun; unwillingly *» He sank into the ocean streams. Then paused The noble Greeks from that ferocious strife, Deadly in equal measure to both hosts. The Trojans also paused, and from their cars</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unharnessed the fleet steeds, and ere they took ** Their evening meal assembled to consult. Standing they held the council; no man cared To sit, for all were trembling from the hour When, long a stranger to the bloody field, Achilles showed himself again. And now i» The son of Panthoiis, wise Polydamas, Began to speak. Beyond the rest he saw Things past and things to come, and he had been Hector's companion, born in the same night, Mighty in speech as Hector with the spear. 3.s With prudent admonitions thus he spake : — "Consider well, my friends. My counsel is That we return, nor wait the holy morn Here, by the fleet and in the open plain, Far from our city ramparts. While this man s*, Was wroth with Agamemnon, we maintained A strife of far less peril with the Greeks, And I was ever ready to encamp By night beside the galleys, which we hoped To make our prize ; but now I fear the might « Of swift Pelides. He will not remain Content upon the space between the fleet And town, where Greeks and Trojans wage a war Of changeful fortune, but will strive to take The city, and to carry off our wives. w March we then homeward. Let my words prevail, — It must be so. The gentle Night now keeps The nimble-footed hero from the war.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But if to-morrow, issuing forth in arms, He find us here, there are among us those i« Who will have cause to know him. Gladly then Will he find refuge who escapes his arm In sacred Troy, and many a Trojan corpse Will feed the dogs and vultures. May mine ear Hear of it never. But if ye will heed i» My words, though sorrowful, ye shall be safe Assembled in the city squares at night. The lofty towers and gates, with massive beams Polished and strongly fitted each to each, Will keep the town. To-morrow we shall take, 3« At dawn, our station on the towers, arrayed In armor, and his difficult task will be, Far from his ships, to fight us from below; And after he has tired his high-necked steeds With coursing round the ramparts to and fro, 3* Back to his galleys he must go; nor yet With all his valor can he force his way Into the town to lay its dwellings waste,— The dogs will feed upon his carcass first." And crested Hector answered with a frown: ass "The counsel thou hast given, Polydamas, Pleases me not, — that we return to be Pent up in Troy. Are ye not weary yet Of lying long imprisoned within walls And towers? The time has been that in all lands, Wherever human speech is heard, the fame 3«1 Of Priam's city, for its treasured gold</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And brass, was in all mouths. Those treasures now Have passed away; our dwellings have them not. Much that we had was sold on Phrygia's coast, .*ss And in Maeonia's pleasant land, for Jove The mighty was displeased with us. But now, When politic Saturn's son hath granted me To win great glory at the fleet, and hold The Greeks imprisoned by the sea, refrain, Idler, from laying counsels such as these Before the people. Not a Trojan here Will follow them, nor would I suffer it. Now hearken all, and act as I advise: First banquet, rank by rank, throughout the host, m And set your guards, and each of you keep watch; And then, if any Trojan stands in fear For his possessions, let him bring them all Into the common stock, to be consumed; Better that we enjoy them than the Greeks. s*, To-morrow, with the dawn and all in arms, We will do battle at the roomy ships Valiantly. If in truth the noble son Of Peleus choose to rise and to defend The ships, so much the worse for him, since I s«s Shall not for him desert the field, but stand Firmly against him, whether he obtain The victory or I. The chance of war Is equal, and the slayer oft is slain." So Hector spake: the Trojans shouted forth w Applause, the madmen! Pallas took away</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their reason; all approved the fatal plan Of Hector; no one ventured to commend The sober counsel of Polydamas. And then they banqueted throughout the host; tx But all night long the Achaians mourned with le^s Patroclus, while Pelides in the midst, Leading the ceaseless lamentation, placed His slaughter-dealing hands upon the breast Of his companion with continual sighs. 4*, As a maned lion, from whose haunt within The thick, dark wood a hunter has borne otf The whelps, returning finds them gone, and grieves, And roams the valleys, tracking as he goes The robber, bent to find him, for his rage *,s Is fierce, — with such fierce sorrow Peleus' son Spake, deeply sighing, to his Myrmidons :— "O, idle were the words which once I spake, When in our palace-halls I bade the chief Menoetius bear a cheerful heart. I said m That I would bring to Opus yet again, Laden with spoil from Ilium overthrown, His valiant son. But Jove doth not fulfil The plans of men. That both of us should stain Earth with our blood in Troy was the decree m Of fate, and never will the aged knight Peleus receive me in his palace-halls, Returning from the war, nor Thetis, she Who gave me birth; the earth will hold me here. And now, since after thee I take my place</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In earth, Patroclus, I will not perform Thy funeral rites before I bring to thee The arms and head of the magnanimous chief Hector, who slew thee. By thy funeral pile I will strike off in vengeance for thy death 4»$ The heads of twelve illustrious Trojan youths. Thou meanwhile, lying at the beaked ships, Shalt be lamented night and day, with tears, By many a Trojan and Dardanian maid, Deep-bosomed, won by our victorious spears o» After hard wars and opulent cities sacked." Thus having said, the great Achilles bade Place a huge tripod on the fire in haste, To cleanse Patroclus from the clotted blood. They brought and set upon the glowing hearth 43s A tripod for the bath, and in it poured Water, and piled the wood beneath. The flame Crept up the vessel's rounded sides and warmed The water. When within the murmuring brass It boiled, they washed the dead, and with rich oil w» Anointed him, and filled the open wounds With ointment nine years old; and laying him Upon a couch, they spread from head to foot Fine linen over him, and covered all With a white mantle. Through the hours of night The Myrmidons, lamenting their dead chief, ««• Wept round the swift Achilles. Then did Jove Thus to his wife and sister Juno speak :— "Large-eyed, imperial Juno, thou hast now</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Accomplished thy desire, for thou hast roused « The swift Achilles. There is not a doubt The long-haired Argives owe their birth to thee." And large-eyed Juno answered: "What strange words, Austere Saturnius, hast thou said? A man, A mortal far less skilled in shaping means 4ss To compass ends, might do what I have done Against his fellow-man. Then should not I — Who boast to be the chief of goddesses By birthright, and because I bear the name Of wife to thee who rulest o'er the gods — 4«0 Plan evil to the Trojans, whom I hate?" So talked they. Silver-footed Thetis came Meanwhile to Vulcan's halls, eternal, gemmed With stars, a wonder to the immortals, wrought Of brass by the lame god. She found him there 4«s Sweating and toiling, and with busy hand Plying the bellows. He was fashioning Tripods, a score, to stand beside the wall Of his fair palace. All of these he placed On wheels of gold, that, of their own accord, m They might roll in among the assembled gods, And then roll back, a marvel to behold. So far they all were finished; but not yet Were added the neat handles, and for these The god was forging rivets busily. 47s While thus he labored, with a mind intent Upon his skilful task, on silver feet</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Came Thetis. Charis, of the snowy veil, The beautiful, whom the great god of fire, Vulcan, had made his wife, beheld, and came 4* Forward to meet her, seized her hand, and said :— "O Thetis of the flowing robe, beloved And honored, what has brought thee to our home Thou dost not often visit us. Come in, That I may pay the honors due a guest." 4»s So the bright goddess spake, and led the way, And seated Thetis on a sumptuous throne, With silver studs divinely wrought, and placed A footstool, and called out to Vulcan thus: "Come, Vulcan ; Thetis here hath need of thee." «*, And the great artist, Vulcan, thus replied: "Then of a truth a goddess is within Whom I must ever honor and revere; Who from the danger of my terrible fall Saved me, what time my shameless mother sought To cast me from her sight, for I was lame. «« Then great had been my misery, had not **'Eurynome and Thetis in their laps Received me as I fell, — Eurynome, Daughter of billowy Ocean. There I dwelt j0 0 Nine years, and many ornaments I wrought Of brass, —clasps, buckles, bracelets, necklaces, — Within a vaulted cave, round which the tides Of the vast ocean murmured and flung up Their foam; nor any of the gods or men s0s Knew of my hiding-place, save only they</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who saved me, Thetis and Eurynome. And now, as she is with us, I must make To fair-haired Thetis some thank-offering For having rescued me. Haste, spread the board s,« Amply with generous fare, while I shall lay Aside my bellows and my implements." He spake, and from his anvil-block arose, A mighty bulk; his weak legs under him, Halting, moved painfully. He laid apart His bellows from the fire, and gathered up The scattered implements with which he wrought, And locked them in a silver chest, and wiped With a moist sponge his face and both his hands, Stout neck and hairy chest. He then put on s- His tunic, took his massive regal wand Into his hand, and, tottering, sallied forth. Two golden statues, like in form and look To living maidens, aided with firm gait The monarch's steps. And mind was in their breasts, ?7s And they had speech and strength, and from the gods Had learned becoming arts. Beside their lord They walked and tended him. As he drew near, Halting, to Thetis on the shining throne, He took the goddess by the hand and said :— s* "What cause, O Thetis of the flowing robe, Honored and dear, has brought thee to our home? Not often com'st thou hither. Freely say Whatever lies upon thy mind. My heart</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Commands me to obey, if it be aught 33s That can be done and may be done by me." And Thetis answered, with a gush of tears: "O Vulcan! of the goddesses who dwell Upon Olympus, is there one who bears Such bitter sorrows as Saturnian Jove s#, Inflicts on me, distressed above them all? Me, of the ocean deities, he forced To take a mortal husband, — Peleus, son Of /Eacus, — and to his bed I came Unwillingly. Within his palace-halls, sa Worn with a late old age, my husband lies Now I have other woes; for when a son Was granted me, and I had brought him forth And reared him, flourishing like a young plant, A sapling in a fertile field, and great ss» Among the heroes, — thus maturely trained, I sent him with his beaked ships to Troy, To combat with her sons; but never more Will it be mine to welcome him returned Home to the halls of Peleus. While to me sss He lives, and sees the sunshine, he endures Affliction, nor can I, though at his side, Aid him in aught. The maiden whom the Greeks Decreed him as his prize, the king of men, Atrides, took away, and grief for her s*, Consumes his heart. The Trojans keep the Greeks Beleaguered by their ships, nor suffer them To pass beyond their gates. The elder chiefs</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Implored him to relent, and offered him Large presents; he refused to avert the doom » That threatened them himself, but sent instead Patroclus to the war with his own arms, And with him sent much people. All the day They fought before the Sceean gates; and then Had Ilium fallen, but that Apollo slew s70 The brave son of Menoetius, who had caused Vast slaughter, — slew him fighting in the van Of war, and gave the glory of his death To Hector. Therefore I approach thy knees, And ask for him, my son, so soon to die, s7s Buckler and helm, and beautiful greaves, shut close With clasps, and all the other arm-; complete, Which in the war my son's companion lost. For now Achilles lies upon the ground Bitterly grieving in his inmost soul." s30 And Vulcan, the great artist, answered her: "Be comforted, and take no further thought Of this; for would I could as certainly Shield him from death's dread summons when his hour Is come at last, as I shall have for him sss Beautiful armor ready to put on, And such as every man, of multitudes Who look on it hereafter, shall admire." So speaking he withdrew, and went where lay The bellows, turned them toward the fire, and bade The work begin. From twenty bellows came</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their breath into the furnaces, — a blast Varied in strength as need might be; for now They blew with violence for a hasty task, And then with gentler breath, as Vulcan pleased s9s And as the work required. Upon the fire He laid impenetrable brass, and tin, And precious gold and silver; on its block Placed the huge anvil, took the ponderous sledge, And held the pincers in the other hand. «,» And first he forged the huge and massive shield, Divinely wrought in every part, — its edge Clasped with a triple border, white and bright. A silver belt hung from it, and its folds Were five; a crowd of figures on its disk «os Were fashioned by the artist's passing skill, For here he placed the earth and heaven, and here The great deep and the never-resting sun And the full moon, and here he set the stars That shine in the round heaven, — the Pleiades, «,0 The Hyades, Orion in his strength, And the Bear near him, called by some the Wain, That, wheeling, ke~ps Orion still in sight, Yet bathes not in the waters of the sea. There placed he two fair cities full of men. «is In one were marriages and feasts; they led The brides with flaming torches from their bowers, Along the streets, with many a nuptial song. There the young dancers whirled, and flutes and lyes Gave forth their sounds, and women at the doors</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Stood and admired. Meanwhile a multitude Was in the forum, where a strife went on, — Two men contending for a fine, the price Of one who had been slain. Before the crowd One claimed that he had paid the fine, and one Denied that aught had been received, and both Called for the sentence which should end the strife. The people clamored for both sides, for both Had eager friends; the heralds held the crowd In check; the elders, upon polished stones, ,•*, Sat in a sacred circle. Each one took, In turn, a herald's sceptre in his hand, And, rising, gave his sentence. In the midst Two talents lay in gold, to be the meed Of him whose juster judgment should prevail. «is Around the other city sat two hosts In shining armor, bent to lay it waste, Unless the dwellers would divide their wealth, — All that their pleasant homes contained, — and yield The assailants half. As yet the citizens (*. Had not complied, but secretly had planned An ambush. Their beloved wives meanwhile, And their young children, stood and watched the walls, With aged men among them, while the youths Marched on, with Mars and Pallas at their head, «»s Both wrought in gold, with golden garments on, Stately and large in form, and over all Conspicuous, in bright armor, as became</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The gods; the rest were of an humbler size. And when they reached the spot where they should lie In ambush, by a river's side, a place »«, For watering herds, they sat them down, all armed In shining brass. Apart from all the rest They placed two sentries, on the watch to spy «« The approach of sheep and horned kine. Soon came The herds in sight; two shepherds walked with them, Who, all unweeting of the evil nigh, Solaced their task with music from their reeds. The warriors saw and rushed on them, and took And drave away large prey of beeves, and flocks «« Of fair white sheep, whose keepers they had slain. When the besiegers in their council heard The sound of tumult at the watering-place, They sprang upon their nimble-footed steeds, And overtook the pillagers. Both bands ««s Arrayed their ranks and fought beside the stream, And smote each other. There did Discord rage, And Tumult, and the great Destroyer, Fate. One wounded warrior she had seized alive, And one unbounded yet, and through the field Dragged by the foot another, dead. Her robe Was reddened o'er the shoulders with the blood From human veins. Like living men they ranged The battle-field, and dragged by turns the slain. There too !ie sculptured a broad fallow field «rs Of soft rich mould, thrice ploughed, and over which Walker! many a ploughman, guiding to and fro</span>

					<span>His steers, and when on their return they reached The border of the field the master came To meet them, placing in the hands of each «• A goblet of rich wine. Then turned they back Along the furrows, diligent to reach Their distant end. All dark behind the plough The ridges lay, a marvel to the sight, Like real furrows, though engraved in gold. «s There, too, the artist placed a field which lay Deep in ripe wheat. With sickles in their hands The laborers reaped it. Here the handfuls fell Upon the ground; there binders tied them fast With bands, and made them sheaves. Three bind- ers went *» Close to the reapers,' and behind them boys, Bringing the gathered handfuls in their arms. Mmisteredto the binders. Staff in hand, The master stood among them by the side Of the ranged sheaves and silently rejoiced. *n Meanwhile the servants underneath an oak Prepared a feast apart; they sacrificed A fatling ox and dressed it, while the maids Were kneading for the reapers the white meal. A vineyard also on the shield he graved, 7™ Beautiful, all of gold, and heavily Laden with grapes. Black were the clusters all; The vines were stayed on rows of silver stakes. He drew a blue trench round it, and a hedge Of tin. One only path there was by which</span>

					<span>The vintagers could go to gather grapes. Young maids and striplings of a tender age Bore the sweet fruit in baskets. Midst them all, A youth from his shrill harp drew pleasant sounds, And sang with soft voice to the murmuring strings. They danced around him, beating with quick feet 7« The ground, and sang and shouted joyously. And there the artist wrought a herd of beeves, High-horned, and sculptured all in gold and tin. They issued lowing from their stalls to seek t,s Their pasture, by a murmuring stream, that ran Rapidly through its reeds. Four herdsmen, graved In gold, were with the beeves, and nine fleet dogs Followed. Two lions, seizing on a bull Among the foremost cattle, dragged him off r«, Fearfully bellowing; hounds and herdsmen rushed To rescue him. The lions tore their prey, And lapped the entrails and the crimson blood. Vainly the shepherds pressed around and urged Their dogs, that shrank from fastenmg with their teeth 7»s Upon the lions, but stood near and bayed. There also did illustrious Vulcan grave A fair, broad pasture, in a pleasant glade, Full of white sheep, and stalls, and cottages, And many a shepherd's fold with sheltering roof. 730 And there illustrious Vulcan also wrought A dance, — a maze like that which Daedalus, In the broad realm of Gnossus once contrived</span>

The maidens wore Fine linen robes; the youths had tuuics on Lustrous as oil, and woven daintily. The maids wore wreaths of flowers; the young men swords Of gold in silver belts. They bounded now mo In a swift circle, — as a potter whirls With both his hands a wheel to try its speed, Sitting before it, — then again they crossed Each other, darting to their former place. A multitude around that joyous dance 743 Gathered, and were amused, while from the crowd Two tumblers raised their song, and flung themselves About among the band that trod the dance. Last on the border of that glorious shield He graved in all its strength the ocean-stream. 7s0 And when that huge and massive shield was done, He forged a corselet brighter than the blaze Of fire; he forged a solid helm to fit The hero's temples, shapely and enchased With rare designs, and with a crest of gold. 7ss And last he forged him greaves of ductile tin. When the great artist Vulcan saw his task Complete, he lifted all that armor up And laid it at the feet of her who bore Achilles. Like a falcon in her flight, 7«0 Down plunging from Olympus capped with snow, She bore the shining armor Vulcan gave.</span>
